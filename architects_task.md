# architects_task.md

Purpose:
- active execution control surface only
- exactly one live packet at a time

Metadata:
- Last updated: `2026-04-08 America/Chicago`
- Last updated by: `Codex REPAIR-RESIDUAL-STALE-GHOST-EXCLUSION freeze`
- Authority scope: `live packet control only`

Do not use this file for:
- broad history
- repeated rationale
- test-output dumps
- micro-event notes

## Current active packet

- Packet: `REPAIR-RESIDUAL-STALE-GHOST-EXCLUSION`
- State: `FROZEN / IMPLEMENTATION_READY`
- Execution mode: `SOLO_LEAD / BOUNDED_SUBAGENTS_ALLOWED`
- Current owner: `Architects mainline lead`

## Objective

Remove residual stale-open ghost rows from runtime read views so past-target canonical leftovers stop poisoning open exposure and loader truth after the trace-convergence repair.

## Non-goals

- no ETL/recalibration work
- no broad historical migration/backfill cleanup
- no risk/status/operator summary rewrites
- no exit-writer or settlement-writer changes
- no schema redesign
- no team runtime launch

## Current blocker state

- after the accepted trace packet, live read views still show 12 open rows but only 3 are legitimate future-target positions
- the remaining 9 rows are residual ghosts with past target dates or synthetic stale rows that still poison open exposure and keep loader status degraded
- packet must stay on read-side ghost exclusion only

## Immediate checklist

- [x] `REPAIR-RESIDUAL-STALE-GHOST-EXCLUSION` frozen
- [x] residual ghost contradiction reproduced in packet-bounded tests or notes
- [x] adversarial ghost-exclusion test added
- [x] targeted tests pass
- [x] pre-close critic review passed
- [x] pre-close verifier review passed
- [ ] packet accepted locally
- [ ] post-close third-party critic review passed
- [ ] post-close third-party verifier review passed

## Next required action

1. Accept the repaired residual ghost packet locally and commit the bounded batch.
2. Run post-close critic + verifier on the accepted boundary before freezing the next packet.
3. Do not widen into exit writers, ETL, risk/status/operator summary work, or broad historical cleanup without a new packet.
