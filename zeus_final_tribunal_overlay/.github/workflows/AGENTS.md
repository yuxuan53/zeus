# .github/workflows AGENTS

Workflow files control gate severity and maintenance cost.

## Rules
- blocking only when the signal is reliable and worth ongoing cost
- advisory first for staged checks such as replay parity
- every new gate needs owner, rationale, and sunset/review condition

## Do not
- hard-block on missing external workspace artifacts
- add noisy hooks or redundant gates without net-protection value
