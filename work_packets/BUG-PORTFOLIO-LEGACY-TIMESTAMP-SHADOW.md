# BUG-PORTFOLIO-LEGACY-TIMESTAMP-SHADOW

```yaml
work_packet_id: BUG-PORTFOLIO-LEGACY-TIMESTAMP-SHADOW
packet_type: repair_packet
objective: Remove the legacy timestamp shadow that still forces canonical portfolio truth to degrade to `stale_legacy_fallback` even when the paper-mode projection is otherwise usable.
why_this_now: The accepted trailing-loss packet fixed one shallow risk symptom and exposed the deeper seam beneath it. Fresh verification shows `query_portfolio_loader_view()` returns `ok` on `zeus-paper.db` but `load_portfolio()` still falls back because the unsuffixed `zeus.db` path reports `stale_legacy_fallback`. The active stale ids (`trade-1`, `rt1`, `75c98026-cd5`) are triggered by `position_events_legacy` timestamps newer than `position_current.updated_at`, so the next lawful step is to repair the comparator/shadow seam before touching wider portfolio or settlement authority.
why_not_other_approach:
  - Jump straight to `src/state/portfolio.py` DB-path cleanup | that is a follow-up shadow-cleanup slice; the current root trigger lives in the loader comparator path
  - Widen into settlement summary dedupe now | separate authority seam; do not merge two bottom-layer repairs into one packet
  - Leave `stale_legacy_fallback` as advisory | it still forces JSON fallback and keeps portfolio truth on a degraded path
truth_layer: canonical portfolio truth should not degrade merely because legacy timestamps shadow `position_current.updated_at` without proving that the projection is semantically behind for the active mode.
control_layer: keep the packet bounded to `src/state/db.py`, packet-bounded tests, and control surfaces. Do not widen into `src/state/portfolio.py`, `src/riskguard/**`, `src/observability/**`, or settlement dedupe logic in this packet.
evidence_layer: work-packet grammar output, kernel-manifest check output, targeted truth-surface tests, and a direct loader probe note showing the stale ids before repair and canonical `ok` behavior after repair.

rollback: Revert the comparator/shadow fix, paired tests, and control-surface updates together; repo returns to the accepted trailing-loss boundary with the legacy timestamp shadow still forcing fallback.
acceptance:
  - `query_portfolio_loader_view()` no longer returns `stale_legacy_fallback` for the identified paper-mode shadow ids when the projection is otherwise canonical for the active mode
  - targeted comparator/shadow tests pass and directly prove same-phase legacy shadows are ignored while true later semantic lag still forces degraded loader truth
  - the packet leaves `src/state/portfolio.py` DB-path cleanup and settlement-summary dedupe explicitly open as follow-up work
evidence_required:
  - work-packet grammar output
  - kernel-manifest check output
  - targeted truth-surface pytest output
  - direct loader probe note
```

## Notes

- This packet is intentionally narrower than a full portfolio-truth unification package.
- The critic/reviewer lane must keep asking whether the fix removes false degradation without hiding any real semantic lag in the projection path.
- If implementation proves `load_portfolio()` itself must change, stop and freeze the follow-up packet rather than widening this one silently.

## Evidence log

- 2026-04-09: `e3f5deb` synchronized the packet boundary after comparator verification.
- 2026-04-09: fresh work-packet and kernel checks passed.
- 2026-04-09: targeted comparator/shadow tests passed (`3 passed`).
- 2026-04-09: direct loader probe showed `zeus-paper.db -> ok`, `zeus.db -> stale_legacy_fallback` only for `08d6c939-038`.
