# GOV-PACKET-ENTRY-CONTROL-SURFACE

```yaml
work_packet_id: GOV-PACKET-ENTRY-CONTROL-SURFACE
packet_type: governance_packet
objective: Archive the legacy root/architects ledger files as active control surfaces and make the current work packet the live control entry surface.
why_this_now: After the authority-amendment packet, the user explicitly directed that `root_progress.md`, `root_task.md`, `architects_state_index.md`, `architects_task.md`, and `architects_progress.md` should no longer remain active surfaces. Fresh authority review confirms those ledgers are procedural/control artifacts rather than principal authority, and that the cleanest replacement is to treat the current `work_packets/<active-packet>.md` file as the live control entry surface, with `docs/known_gaps.md` remaining the active antibody register.
why_not_other_approach:
  - Keep the ledgers active | directly conflicts with the updated user directive
  - Introduce another new live ledger file | would recreate the same control-surface sprawl under a different name
  - Archive the ledgers immediately without updating references | would strand many work packets and routing files without a clear live entry surface
truth_layer: the live control entry surface should be the current work packet, while root/architects ledgers become historical records.
control_layer: keep this packet bounded to control-surface demotion, archive moves, and reference updates. Do not widen into constitutions, runtime code, or unrelated docs cleanup in this packet.
evidence_layer: work-packet grammar output, kernel-manifest check output, control-surface reference inventory, and a post-move reference scan proving the legacy ledger paths are no longer treated as active control authority.

rollback: Revert the control-surface replacement and archive moves together; repo returns to the post-close authority-amendment baseline with legacy ledgers still active.
acceptance:
  - the current work packet is explicitly named as the live control entry surface in top routing files
  - `root_progress.md`, `root_task.md`, `architects_state_index.md`, `architects_task.md`, and `architects_progress.md` are archived or explicitly demoted to historical-only surfaces
  - top routing/orientation files no longer point at the superseded ledger paths as active control authority
  - post-move reference scans show remaining mentions of the superseded ledgers are archive/historical only or explicit compatibility-only notes
evidence_required:
  - work-packet grammar output
  - kernel-manifest check output
  - control-surface reference inventory
  - post-move reference scan
```

## Notes

- This packet supersedes the earlier assumption that either `root_*` or `architects_*` ledgers would remain live control surfaces.
- It should not create a new long-lived ledger replacement unless implementation proves a minimal shim is unavoidable.

## Evidence log

- Fresh reference inventory showed `root_*` and `architects_*` control ledgers still heavily referenced across work packets and orientation files.
- The chosen replacement is a single `CURRENT_STATE.md` pointer plus the current work packet itself as the live control surface.
