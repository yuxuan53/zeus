# BUG-CANONICAL-CLOSURE-TRACEABILITY

```yaml
work_packet_id: BUG-CANONICAL-CLOSURE-TRACEABILITY
packet_type: bugfix_packet
objective: Restore one truthful closure path so execution facts, outcome facts, and settlement legality stay durable and semantically aligned when positions move from exit attempts into settlement/closure.
why_this_now: BUG-BANKROLL-TRUTH-CONSISTENCY is closed. Fresh repo truth still shows the next highest-leverage end-to-end lifecycle loss on the close path: `log_execution_report()` and `log_settlement_event()` short-circuit on canonical-only substrates before emitting `execution_fact` / `outcome_fact`, while the harvester settlement path explicitly permits `pending_exit + backoff_exhausted` to settle even though `enter_settled_runtime_state()` does not legalize that transition. This keeps the discovered→bought→held→exited→settled trace from being durably complete and semantically lawful.
why_not_other_approach:
  - Patch execution_fact, outcome_fact, and settlement legality separately | would preserve one bottom-layer closure seam split across multiple local fixes
  - Jump directly to projection/query-hint cleanup | reader-shape cleanup matters, but durable close-path writes and legality must be truthful first
  - Widen into ETL/recalibration contamination now | separate external-data truth family, not the next close-path runtime seam
truth_layer: close-path truth must remain durable when canonical tables exist, and settlement legality for `backoff_exhausted` positions must match the lifecycle kernel instead of being silently special-cased by one module.
control_layer: limit the change to `src/state/db.py`, `src/execution/harvester.py`, `src/state/lifecycle_manager.py`, and packet-bounded tests that prove canonical-only present/absent behavior plus lawful settlement transitions. Do not widen into projection-query compatibility cleanup, control-plane work, migrations, or ETL contamination.
evidence_layer: work-packet grammar output, kernel-manifest check output, targeted closure-path pytest output, and a short closure-contract note describing present-path and absent-path semantics.

rollback: Revert the close-path durability and lifecycle-legality edits together; repo returns to the current bankroll-truth boundary with canonical closure drift still explicitly open.
acceptance:
  - `log_execution_report()` and `log_settlement_event()` no longer silently skip durable closure facts when canonical surfaces are present
  - `backoff_exhausted` settlement handling is semantically aligned between harvester and the lifecycle kernel
  - targeted tests prove capability-present and capability-absent behavior without widening into projection or control-plane cleanup
  - targeted tests pass and the control surfaces record the packet boundary truthfully
evidence_required:
  - work-packet grammar output
  - kernel-manifest check output
  - targeted closure-path pytest output
  - closure-contract note

## Notes

- This packet is the next K-level seam after bankroll truth: durable close-path traceability and lifecycle legality.
- Degraded-path rule for this packet: if canonical closure substrates are absent, the touched code must surface explicit skip/fail-loud semantics rather than silently implying durable completion.
- If implementation shows the fix requires projection-query compatibility cleanup, control-plane migration, or ETL/recalibration work, stop and freeze a new packet instead of widening this one.
- Closure-contract note:
  - present path: when canonical position tables exist and `execution_fact` / `outcome_fact` are available, `log_execution_report()` and `log_settlement_event()` must keep writing durable facts even if legacy runtime `position_events` is absent; only the legacy event append is skipped
  - absent path: when both legacy runtime event schema and canonical position surfaces are absent, the touched code still fails loud on missing legacy runtime schema; when fact tables are absent, `log_execution_fact()` / `log_outcome_fact()` continue to return explicit `skipped_missing_table`
  - settlement legality: `pending_exit` may fold to `settled` only for the bounded `backoff_exhausted` path; the harvester canonical phase-before must reflect that pending-exit truth instead of pretending the position stayed active
