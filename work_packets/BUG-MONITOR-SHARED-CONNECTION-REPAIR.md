# BUG-MONITOR-SHARED-CONNECTION-REPAIR

```yaml
work_packet_id: BUG-MONITOR-SHARED-CONNECTION-REPAIR
packet_type: bugfix_packet
objective: Give the monitoring / exit-context path an explicit trade+shared connection seam so it can read shared calibration / observation truth without silently falling back to the legacy monolithic connection, and so the known `monitor_incomplete_exit_context` gap can be reduced on positions that already have complete data.
why_this_now: Current repo truth still routes the cycle runner monitoring path through the legacy single-DB connection seam, while the live/session evidence shows `monitor_incomplete_exit_context` remaining non-zero for positions that should have complete exit authority. The session notes explicitly called out the question of whether monitoring uses a trade+shared connection or just the legacy seam.
why_not_other_approach:
  - Leave monitoring on the legacy connection and treat the incomplete-context count as acceptable | preserves the isolation/drift risk and keeps shared calibration truth hidden behind the old seam
  - Split this into separate packets for connection helper, runtime wiring, and tests | the seam change is small enough to remain one bounded non-destructive packet if kept inside the runtime/DB/test boundary
  - Fix bankroll semantics first | that is a different question and does not address the shared-truth access gap that drives the current incomplete-context evidence
truth_layer: The monitoring path should read trade truth plus shared world truth through an explicit attached connection seam; if the shared substrate is unavailable, the path must fail closed or skip loudly rather than pretend the legacy monolithic seam is equivalent.
control_layer: Limit the change to the runtime monitoring connection seam, the explicit shared-attachment helper if one is needed, and targeted regression tests. Do not widen into migration/cutover, RiskGuard policy, or bankroll redesign.
evidence_layer: work-packet grammar output, kernel-manifest check output, targeted runtime tests proving shared-connected monitoring behavior, explicit absent-path evidence, and a short connection-contract note.

rollback: Revert the shared-connection helper / runtime wiring / targeted test changes together; the repo returns to the current single-DB monitoring seam and the incomplete-context gap remains explicitly open.
acceptance:
  - the monitoring path uses an explicit trade+shared connection seam rather than the legacy monolithic connection
  - the packet proves shared-present monitoring can resolve exit-context completeness for the known gap without inventing new truth
  - the packet proves the shared-absent path fails closed or skips loudly rather than silently pretending the old seam is equivalent
  - targeted tests pass and the control surfaces record the packet boundary truthfully
evidence_required:
  - work-packet grammar output
  - kernel-manifest check output
  - targeted runtime pytest output

```

## Notes

- This packet is intentionally narrower than a full runtime or migration rewrite.
- If the fix requires wider lifecycle or cutover changes, stop and freeze a new packet instead of widening this one.
- Team work inside this packet is allowed only as bounded read-review / implementation / verification slices under one owner.

## Evidence log

- work-packet grammar output: `python3 scripts/check_work_packets.py` -> `work packet grammar ok`
- kernel-manifest check output: `python3 scripts/check_kernel_manifests.py` -> `kernel manifests ok`
- targeted runtime pytest output: `.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_runtime_guards.py -k "exit_context or monitor"` -> `12 passed, 68 deselected`; `.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_live_safety_invariants.py -k incomplete_context` -> `2 passed, 52 deselected`; `.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_pnl_flow_and_audit.py -k monitor` -> `1 passed, 48 deselected`
- connection-contract note: `src/engine/cycle_runner.py` preserves the `get_connection` monkeypatch surface but now defaults it to `get_trade_connection_with_shared()`, and `src/state/db.py` exports one non-shadowed helper that opens the mode-specific trade DB then `ATTACH`es `ZEUS_SHARED_DB_PATH` as `shared`; `tests/test_runtime_guards.py::test_run_cycle_monitoring_uses_attached_shared_connection` and `::test_run_cycle_monitoring_fails_loudly_when_shared_seam_unavailable` cover shared-present and shared-absent behavior.
