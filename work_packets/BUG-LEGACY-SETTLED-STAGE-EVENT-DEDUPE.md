# BUG-LEGACY-SETTLED-STAGE-EVENT-DEDUPE

```yaml
work_packet_id: BUG-LEGACY-SETTLED-STAGE-EVENT-DEDUPE
packet_type: repair_packet
objective: Deduplicate legacy `POSITION_SETTLED` stage events before they feed authoritative settlement queries, so settlement sample counts and strategy settlement summaries stop disagreeing with headline realized PnL.
why_this_now: Fresh verification after freezing the fallback-reader dedupe packet showed the live paper mismatch still comes first from duplicated legacy `POSITION_SETTLED` rows in `position_events_legacy`, not from `decision_log` fallback flattening. `query_authoritative_settlement_rows()` prefers `query_settlement_events()` first, and the active duplicate trade ids (`0c108102-032`, `6f8ce461-902`, `9e97c78f-2a8`) are doubled there. The fallback-reader packet is therefore superseded before implementation by this tighter packet on the real first-counting seam.
why_not_other_approach:
  - Keep implementing the decision_log fallback dedupe packet first | it would not fix the live mismatch while stage-event duplicates still win first
  - Jump to RiskGuard output parity immediately | the root duplication still enters earlier at the stage-event reader
  - Merge stage-event dedupe with comparator cleanup | separate bottom-layer truth seams; keep the packet narrow
truth_layer: legacy stage-event compatibility rows may still exist, but authoritative settlement queries must not count the same settled trade more than once when multiple legacy `POSITION_SETTLED` rows exist for that trade.
control_layer: keep the packet bounded to `src/state/db.py`, packet-bounded tests, and control surfaces. Do not widen into `src/state/decision_chain.py` fallback dedupe or `src/riskguard/**` output parity in this packet.
evidence_layer: work-packet grammar output, kernel-manifest check output, targeted settlement-query pytest output, and a direct repro note showing duplicate stage events before repair and deduped latest-wins rows after repair.

rollback: Revert the stage-event dedupe change, paired tests, and control-surface updates together; repo returns to the accepted mode-db-probe boundary with duplicate legacy stage events still inflating authoritative settlement rows.
acceptance:
  - duplicate legacy `POSITION_SETTLED` rows for the same `runtime_trade_id` are deduped at the stage-event query path using a deterministic latest-wins rule
  - targeted tests prove duplicate stage events collapse to one logical authoritative settlement row
  - the packet leaves `src/state/decision_chain.py` fallback-reader dedupe and any RiskGuard output parity assertions explicitly open unless they prove necessary later
evidence_required:
  - work-packet grammar output
  - kernel-manifest check output
  - targeted settlement-query pytest output
  - direct duplicate-stage-event repro note
```

## Notes

- This packet supersedes the just-frozen fallback-reader dedupe packet as the immediate fix for the live mismatch.
- The fallback-reader dedupe remains a later compatibility cleanup slice, but it is not the first-counting seam for the active paper contradiction.
- If implementation proves the RiskGuard output layer also needs a parity assertion, freeze that next packet explicitly instead of widening silently.

## Evidence log

- Pending implementation.
