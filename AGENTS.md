# Zeus AGENTS

Zeus is a **live quantitative trading engine** operating in Polymarket weather derivatives.

It converts atmospheric data into sized limit orders with positive expectation, bound by market settlement mechanics and dynamic risk limits.

**THE MONEY PATH (Your Primary Mental Model):**
The pipeline is causal and linear. Every component evaluates against this chain:
`contract semantics -> source truth -> forecast signal -> calibration -> edge -> execution -> monitoring -> settlement -> learning`

**THE PROBABILITY CHAIN (How We Trade):**
The mathematical construction of an edge:
`51 ENS members -> per-member daily max -> Monte Carlo (sensor noise + ASOS rounding) -> P_raw -> Extended Platt (A·logit + B·lead_days + C) -> P_cal -> α-weighted Market Fusion -> P_posterior -> Edge & Double-Bootstrap CI -> Fractional Kelly -> Position Size`

**TOPOLOGY NAVIGATION:**
Before modifying code, run the topology doctor. It returns which files you may
change, which you must not touch, what tests must pass, and when to stop — scope
that grep cannot provide:
`python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --navigation --task "<your task>" --files <files>`

For pipeline-impacting tasks (pricing, data, risk, settlement), also load the
boot profile and answer the proof questions before modifying code:
`python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --task-boot-profiles`

Read this file first to establish the money path, then route directly to the specific execution module or manifest governing your task.

## 1. The Trading Machine

Zeus turns weather forecasts and settlement observations into calibrated market
probabilities, sized positions, execution decisions, monitoring, exits, and
settlement follow-through.

The runtime entry points are:

- `src/main.py` - live daemon entry
- `src/engine/cycle_runner.py` - cycle orchestration
- `src/engine/evaluator.py` - candidate to decision pipeline
- `src/execution/executor.py` - live order placement
- `src/engine/monitor_refresh.py` and `src/execution/exit_triggers.py` -
  monitoring and exits
- `src/execution/harvester.py` - settlement and learning follow-through

The truth path is:

`chain/CLOB facts -> canonical DB/events -> projections/status -> derived reports`

Zeus is dual-track. High and low temperature families share local-calendar-day
geometry and do not share physical quantity, observation field, Day0 causality,
or calibration family.

### Settlement mechanics

Polymarket weather markets settle on integer temperatures reported by Weather
Underground. Settlement is discrete, not continuous. A real temperature of
74.45°F → sensor reads 74.2°F → METAR rounds → WU displays 74°F.

`SettlementSemantics.assert_settlement_value()` gates every DB write. Three bin
types exist:

| Type | Example | Cardinality |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `point` | 10°C resolves on {10} | 1 |
| `finite_range` | 50-51°F resolves on {50, 51} | 2 |
| `open_shoulder` | 75°F+ (unbounded) | unbounded |

Shoulder bins are not symmetric bounded ranges. Do not infer bin semantics from
label punctuation or continuous-interval intuition.

**Key file**: `src/contracts/settlement_semantics.py`

### Risk levels

Risk levels change runtime behavior. Advisory-only risk is forbidden (INV-05).

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| GREEN | Normal operation |
| YELLOW | No new entries, continue monitoring |
| ORANGE | No new entries, exit at favorable prices |
| RED | Cancel all pending, sweep all active positions |

Overall level = max of all individual levels. Computation error or broken truth
input → RED. Fail-closed.

**Key file**: `src/riskguard/risk_level.py`

### Position lifecycle

9 states in `LifecyclePhase` enum:

`pending_entry → active → day0_window → pending_exit → economically_closed → settled`

Terminal states: `voided`, `quarantined`, `admin_closed`.

Exit intent is not closure. Settlement is not exit. No code may invent phase
strings outside the enum.

**Key file**: `src/state/lifecycle_manager.py`

### Chain reconciliation

Every cycle reconciles local state against on-chain truth:

`Chain (Polymarket CLOB) > Chronicler (event log) > Portfolio (local cache)`

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Local + chain match | SYNCED |
| Local exists, NOT on chain | VOID immediately (local state is a hallucination) |
| Chain exists, NOT local | QUARANTINE 48h (unknown asset, forced exit eval) |

**Key file**: `src/state/chain_reconciliation.py`

### Strategy families

Zeus operates four independent strategy families with distinct alpha profiles:

| Strategy | Edge source | Alpha decay |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Settlement Capture | Observed fact post-peak | Very slow (observation speed) |
| Shoulder Bin Sell | Retail cognitive bias | Moderate (competition narrows) |
| Center Bin Buy | Model accuracy vs market | Fast (easily competed away) |
| Opening Inertia | New market mispricing | Fastest (bot scanning) |

`strategy_key` is the sole governance identity for attribution, risk policy,
and performance slicing.

### Durable trading rules

- Canonical DB/event truth outranks derived JSON, CSV, reports, notebooks.
- Live may act. Backtest may evaluate. Shadow is observe-only.
- Settlement values flow through `SettlementSemantics`.
- High and low rows must not mix in calibration, Platt fitting, replay bin
  lookup, or settlement rebuild identity.
- DB commits must precede derived JSON export writes.
- `RED` risk must cancel pending orders and sweep active positions.
- Authority-loss must degrade monitor/exit lanes to read-only, not kill
  the cycle.

For the complete mathematical specification — worked examples, formula
derivations, strategy taxonomy, and failure case studies — read
`docs/reference/zeus_domain_model.md`.

## 2. Platform Operations & Change Control

The repository utilizes a change-control layer to ensure trading logic remains
isolated and explicitly versioned. A cold-start agent must answer four
operational questions before pushing changes:

1. What is current law?
2. What is active right now?
3. What is derived context, not authority?
4. Where does history live without becoming default context?

The durable workspace kernel is:

- machine manifests under `architecture/**`
- `architecture/module_manifest.yaml` for the dense module-reference layer
- scoped `AGENTS.md` routers
- `docs/reference/modules/**` for dense module books when a module router or
  manifest sends you there
- `docs/operations/current_state.md`, `docs/operations/known_gaps.md`, and the
  active packet folder
- derived context engines such as `topology_doctor`, source rationale, history
  lore, and Code Review Graph

## 3. Navigation & Task Routing

**Step 1 — Run the topology digest for your task.** This is not optional. The
digest returns your scoped change set, forbidden files, safety gates, and stop
conditions — information that grep cannot provide.

```
python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --navigation --task "<your task>" --files <files>
```

The output contains:
- `required_law` — invariants you must not violate
- `allowed_files` — the files you may change
- `forbidden_files` — do not touch
- `gates` — tests/checks that must pass before merge
- `downstream` — files affected by your change
- `stop_conditions` — scope boundaries that trigger "stop and plan"
- `source_rationale` — per-file zone, hazards, and write routes
- `history_lore` — relevant historical failure lessons

**Step 2 — Read the scoped AGENTS.md** for the module you will touch. These
contain domain rules, common mistakes, and hazard classifications specific to
that package.

**Step 3 — Read reference docs only when the task requires pipeline knowledge.**
Do not default-read all references. The digest profile tells you which laws
apply; read the reference that explains those laws:
- `docs/reference/zeus_domain_model.md` — domain model, worked examples, strategy taxonomy
- `docs/reference/zeus_math_spec.md` — probability chain formulas, calibration math
- `docs/reference/zeus_market_settlement_reference.md` — bin topology, settlement semantics, sensor physics
- `docs/reference/zeus_execution_lifecycle_reference.md` — lifecycle state machine, chain reconciliation, executor
- `docs/reference/zeus_risk_strategy_reference.md` — risk levels, Kelly sizing, edge decay
- `docs/reference/zeus_data_and_replay_reference.md` — database topology, data ingestion, dual-track identity
- `docs/reference/zeus_failure_modes_reference.md` — code-grounded failure modes with invariant anchors

### Digest profiles

The digest engine matches your task description against configured profiles.
Named profiles: `change settlement rounding`, `edit replay fidelity`,
`add a data backfill`, `add or change script`, `extract historical lore`,
`reference artifact extraction`. Unmatched tasks get a generic profile.

For a task-only digest without health checks:
```
python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py digest --task "<task>" --files <files>
```

### Semantic boot (pipeline-impacting tasks)

For settlement, source, observation, Day0, or calibration work, the digest alone
is not enough. Run the boot profile check:
```
python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --task-boot-profiles
```

Answer the profile's proof questions before treating code structure as sufficient
context. The profile names required current-fact surfaces — read them:
- `docs/operations/current_source_validity.md`
- `docs/operations/current_data_state.md`
- `architecture/task_boot_profiles.yaml`
- `architecture/fatal_misreads.yaml`

`architecture/city_truth_contract.yaml` defines the stable source-role schema;
it is not a current per-city truth table.

### Additional topology commands

- `python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --planning-lock --changed-files <files>` — check if changes require planning evidence
- `python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --map-maintenance --changed-files <files>` — check companion registry updates
- `python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --code-review-graph-status --json` — Code Review Graph freshness
- `python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py impact --files <files>` — source impact summary
- `python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py context-pack --task "<task>" --files <files>` — full agent context packet

### Code Review Graph

Follows `architecture/code_review_graph_protocol.yaml`: Stage 1 is semantic
boot; Stage 2 is graph context. Prefer official upstream graph operations
(`code-review-graph status/update/watch`) over repo-local inventions. Graph
output is derived context — never authority.

### High-risk zero-context work

When touching K0/K1, schema, governance, control, lifecycle, or DB authority,
add these reads after the topology digest:
- `architecture/self_check/zero_context_entry.md`
- `architecture/self_check/authority_index.md`

The runtime mode manifest is `architecture/runtime_modes.yaml`; the supported
discovery modes are `opening_hunt`, `update_reaction`, and `day0_capture`.

## 4. Operational Reference

### Authority classification

**Authority** — surfaces that grant permission, define truth, or enforce
behavior: system/developer/user instructions, machine-checkable manifests and
tests, active packet control surfaces, executable source and canonical DB truth.

**Derived context** — helps routing and review but never outranks authority:
`topology_doctor` digests, `architecture/source_rationale.yaml`,
`architecture/history_lore.yaml`, `architecture/code_review_graph_protocol.yaml`,
`.code-review-graph/graph.db`.

**History** — visible interface (`docs/archive_registry.md`) and dense lessons
(`architecture/history_lore.yaml`). Archive bodies are cold storage, not
default-read. Label archive-derived claims as `[Archive evidence]`.

### Planning lock

Stop and plan before touching: `architecture/**`, `docs/authority/**`,
`.github/workflows/**`, `src/state/**` truth ownership / schema / projection /
lifecycle write paths, `src/control/**`, `src/supervisor_api/**`, cross-zone
changes, more than 4 changed files, anything described as canonical truth /
lifecycle / governance / control / DB authority.

Machine check:
`python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --planning-lock --changed-files <files...> --plan-evidence <plan file>`

### Change classification

- **Math**: stays inside existing semantic contracts
- **Architecture**: changes canonical read/write paths, lifecycle grammar, truth
  ownership, DB/schema, point-in-time semantics, or zone boundaries
- **Governance**: changes manifests, AGENTS, packets, constitutions, routing, or
  control surfaces

### Mesh maintenance

When adding, renaming, or deleting a file:

1. update the manifest that owns the registry when one exists
2. update the scoped `AGENTS.md` if local routes or file registries change
3. update `workspace_map.md` when directory-level structure or visibility
   classes change

Unregistered files are invisible to future agents.

Registry routes: `src/**` → `architecture/source_rationale.yaml`,
`scripts/*` → `architecture/script_manifest.yaml`,
`tests/test_*.py` → `architecture/test_topology.yaml`,
`docs/reference/*` → `docs/reference/AGENTS.md` and
`architecture/reference_replacement.yaml`.

Check:
`python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --map-maintenance --map-maintenance-mode advisory|precommit|closeout`

### What to read by task

Always start with the topology digest (§3 Step 1). The digest gives you
`allowed_files`, `gates`, and `stop_conditions` for your task. The list below
adds supplemental reads the digest cannot provide:

- Pipeline-impacting work: add `docs/reference/zeus_domain_model.md` and the
  targeted module book after the digest
- Source edits: add scoped `src/**/AGENTS.md` and
  `architecture/module_manifest.yaml` after the digest
- K0/K1 truth or lifecycle: add `docs/authority/zeus_current_architecture.md`
  and `architecture/kernel_manifest.yaml` after the digest
- Delivery/governance: add `docs/authority/zeus_current_delivery.md`,
  `docs/operations/current_state.md`, and active packet docs
- Historical failure context: `architecture/history_lore.yaml` (the digest
  includes matched lore cards; read the full file only when investigating
  failure patterns)

### Git safety

Never run destructive git commands or overwrite unrelated dirty work without
explicit human approval. Preserve untracked local inputs, runtime artifacts, and
other packets unless the active packet explicitly governs them.
