# Authority basis: operator delta-package v2 (real_upgrade #3) — pre-submit Day0 live admission
#   circuit breakers. These do NOT change q, edge, or Kelly; they decide whether an immature Day0
#   live lane is allowed to submit live capital. Applied in the final submit path, AFTER event
#   binding / selected proof and BEFORE Kelly / final intent. Scoped to DAY0_EXTREME_UPDATED events
#   only — non-day0 candidates pass through untouched (returns None).
"""day0_live_admission_rejection_reason — promotion circuit breakers for the Day0 live lane.

Pure predicate over assembled facts: returns a rejection-reason string (the FIRST failing gate) or
None when the candidate is admissible. The caller assembles the context from existing systems and,
on a non-None reason, records a NO-submit receipt with that reason instead of submitting.

    #       config/settings.json's edli section has no per-city Day0 field from
    #       which a genuine allowlist could be derived.

    #       module was even created: 2026-06-09 ("全部打开") and 2026-06-12
    #       ("现在就解除这些限制") made Day0 live with no parallel observation stage. This
    #       module's authority-basis header dates it 2026-06-17 — five days AFTER that final
