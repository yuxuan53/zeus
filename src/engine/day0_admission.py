# Authority basis: operator delta-package v2 (real_upgrade #3) — pre-submit Day0 live admission
#   circuit breakers. These do NOT change q, edge, or Kelly; they decide whether an immature Day0
#   live lane is allowed to submit live capital. Applied in the final submit path, AFTER event
#   binding / selected proof and BEFORE Kelly / final intent. Scoped to DAY0_EXTREME_UPDATED events
#   only — non-day0 candidates pass through untouched (returns None).
"""day0_live_admission_rejection_reason — promotion circuit breakers for the Day0 live lane.

Pure predicate over assembled facts: returns a rejection-reason string (the FIRST failing gate) or
None when the candidate is admissible. The caller assembles the context from existing systems and,
on a non-None reason, records a NO-submit receipt with that reason instead of submitting.

    # whole: n=315, net -$489, 6/7 ISO weeks negative. Split on this predicate it is not
    # one lane but two populations:
    #
    #   distinct asks >= 2  n=95   net -$382.53 on $678.89   net/cost -0.563   7/7 weeks -
    #   distinct asks <  2  n=220  net -$106.57 on $1447.66  net/cost -0.074

    # (240 m: -12.9c) while quiet-book entries are flat. The repricing IS the market
    # reacting to the same information we just acted on; by the time we cross, the ask
    # we lift is the stale side of a move already in progress. That is why the cut is
    # an ADMISSION rule and not an exit or sizing rule — the entry itself is the error.

    # Threshold: >= 2 distinct values, i.e. the book moved at all. The stricter >= 3
    # alternative was measured on the same chain truth and is kept on record here:

    #   >= 3  removes n=39  net -$270.40  (55% of loss)  LCB -$448  5/6 wk  test -$103.04
    #
    # >= 3 makes fewer false removals (5 vs 23), but those are dust and are already
    # netted into the figures above; >= 2 avoids $112 more loss pooled and $76 more in
    # the test window, so it is the threshold that ships.
