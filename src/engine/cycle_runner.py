    Marks all active (non-terminal) positions with `exit_reason="red_force_exit"`
    so the existing exit_lifecycle machinery picks them up on the next
    monitor_refresh cycle and posts sell orders through the normal exit lane.

    Does NOT post sell orders in-cycle — keeps the sweep low-risk + testable.
    Already-exiting positions (non-empty `exit_reason` from a prior exit flow)
    are NOT overridden — we mark only positions that have no exit flow yet.

    Law reference: docs/authority/zeus_current_architecture.md §17 +

    this decision; it does not preempt it.

    Fail-closed rules:
    - Any non-GREEN risk_level → blocked (fails closed on unknown future levels).
    - Status dicts missing the "entry" key default to not allowing submit.
    - Degraded/unknown forecast freshness blocks entries while monitor/exit
      lanes continue; it is not an observability-only tag.

    Quarantine excision T2 (docs/rebuild/quarantine_excision_2026-07-11.md):
    the portfolio-wide ``has_quarantine`` kwarg is REMOVED — the disease it
    guarded against (any one quarantine fact freezing ALL new entries) routed
    through two replacements instead: (1) an OPEN unbounded
    EntryExposureObligation now folds into ``risk_level`` as DATA_DEGRADED at
    the RiskGuard tick (src.riskguard.riskguard._unresolved_exposure_data_
    degraded_level), so ``_risk_allows_new_entries(risk_level)`` above already
    carries that signal — no separate kwarg needed; (2) family-scoped blocks
    (open ChainOnlyFact / family-blocking ReviewWorkItem / OPEN
    EntryExposureObligation / bridging quarantined-position family) are
    handled PER-CANDIDATE at the evaluator's candidate-screening seam
    (src.engine.evaluator.evaluate_candidate), never in this global fold.
