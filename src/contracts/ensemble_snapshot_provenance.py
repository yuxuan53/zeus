"""Ensemble-snapshot provenance quarantine contract.

Single source of truth for which ``data_version`` values are forbidden
on the ``ensemble_snapshots`` table. Any writer (live ingest, backfill,
or rebuild) MUST consult this contract before inserting rows. Any
reader that fetches snapshots for calibration MUST call
``assert_data_version_allowed`` on each row before forwarding it to
the Platt training path.

2026-04-14 quarantine rationale
-------------------------------
The TIGGE ``param_167`` (``2t`` / ``stepType=instant``) archive was
downloaded with the wrong physical quantity. Each stored
``members_json`` vector is a **per-member point temperature at
``issue_time + step`` hours (UTC)**, not the per-member local-day
maximum that the live path consumes via
``src/signal/ensemble_signal.py::member_maxes_for_target_date``.

Training Platt on point forecasts but querying it with daily-max
inputs at inference time produces a systematic train/infer geometry
mismatch that neither density normalization nor Platt's ``C*lead_days``
term can repair. The replacement archive is ``param=121.128`` / ``mx2t6``
(``stepType=max``, 6-hour sliding windows) composited into per-member
**local calendar-day max**, tagged in DB as
``tigge_mx2t6_local_calendar_day_max_v1`` (Phase 4 canonical).
The intermediate ``tigge_mx2t6_local_peak_window_max_v1`` tag (peak-window
semantics, now superseded) is also quarantined — it is a different physical
quantity than the local-calendar-day product the live path requires.

Until that replacement lands, the old ``param_167`` variants must be
kept out of every live calibration path — not just filtered at read
time, but refused at write time too, so nothing downstream can rely on
"the table is clean because I cleared it yesterday". This contract is
the refusal point.

Semantics
---------
- ``QUARANTINED_DATA_VERSIONS``: exact-match set — versions that are
  known to exist in the archive and MUST never be touched.
- ``QUARANTINED_DATA_VERSION_PREFIXES``: prefix-match tuple — catches
  near-future variants (e.g. ``tigge_step024_v2_*`` that may be produced
  by an experimental ingest path). Prefix match is deliberately
  conservative: a legitimate ``tigge_mx2t6_*`` version does NOT match
  any quarantine prefix.
- Both sets are additive; extend them if new failure modes surface.

Failure mode on write
---------------------
Writers call ``assert_data_version_allowed`` and let
``DataVersionQuarantinedError`` propagate. That bubbles up the caller
(live ingest, backfill, test fixture) and fails loudly, which is what
we want — silent drops hide bugs.

Failure mode on read
--------------------
Callers can use ``is_quarantined`` to partition rows (drop silently,
count, log). ``rebuild_calibration_pairs_canonical.py`` does this so
dry-run reports always surface the refusal count even when
``--allow-unaudited-ensemble`` is passed.
