"""Typed registry for no_trade_regret_events.rejection_reason (K2.1).

THE DISEASE THIS KILLS: rejection reasons were free-text strings — structured
prefixes at best ("BASE:detail:detail"), raw exception text at worst ("UNIQUE
constraint failed: platt_models...", "database is locked", "name '...' is not
defined" all appear in the live table). Every funnel query was substring-matching
prose, and a new emit site could invent a new spelling silently.

THE CONTRACT:
- Every rejection reason BASE (the token before the first ':') is a declared
  member of :class:`RejectionReason`, carrying a category and a docstring.
- Detail stays a colon-suffix (string value preserved for DB compat):
  ``f"{RejectionReason.X.value}:{detail}"`` or the existing literal whose base
  equals a registered value.
- A transparent envelope may carry inner reasons with different categories.
  Its base is registered for runtime/AST hygiene, while ``classify()`` assigns
  the category from the declared inner vocabulary and treats unknown inners as
  ``ARTIFICIAL_SUSPECT``.
- CI antibody (tests/contracts/test_k2_rejection_reason_registry.py) AST-scans
  every EventSubmissionReceipt(reason=...) emit site: a string literal whose
  base is not registered FAILS CI.
- Runtime sensor: the regret-write chokepoint warns (once per base per process)
  on unregistered bases — catches dynamic/exception-leak paths that the AST
  check cannot see.
- The standing funnel report (K5.2) groups by ``classify_rejection_reason``.

Categories (operator-ratified framework, funnel autopsy 2026-06-10):
- HONEST_MARKET: the market itself offers nothing (phase closed, no edge,
  empty native book). Expected, self-resolving, not actionable.
- HONEST_DATA: our inputs honestly not ready (staleness, readiness expired,
  source runs incomplete). Self-resolving on data cadence; actionable only if
  chronically dominant.
- DESIGNED_GATE: a deliberate protection fired as designed (riskguard, Kelly,
  FDR, direction law, submit-time fail-closed aborts).
- ARTIFICIAL_SUSPECT: pipeline-defect signal (build failures, missing proofs
  that the pipeline should have produced, connection/boundary errors, raw
  exception text). Every sustained ARTIFICIAL_SUSPECT stream is a bug hunt.
