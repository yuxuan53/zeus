"""Vig normalization contract — D5 resolution.

D5 gap: p_market includes vig (~0.95–1.05). compute_posterior() blends
α × p_cal + (1-α) × p_market then normalizes. This smears vig bias across all
bins because the blend happens before vig removal. The normalization step partially
corrects it but the blend coefficients were already contaminated.

Resolution: Vig normalization (p_market_clean = p_market / vig) must happen
BEFORE the blend, under a declared VigTreatment contract.
