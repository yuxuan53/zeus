"""SourceContract — the target-namespace declarative registry for R3 (ingest contractualization).

This module is the sole source-contract binding
law for this name: a standalone contract registry that re-declares temporal/family/tier facts
already owned by ``config/source_release_calendar.yaml`` / ``architecture/data_sources_registry_
2026_05_08.yaml`` / ``src/data/forecast_source_registry.py`` would be a FOURTH source of truth
(operator directive 2026-05-24, "don't reinvent what we have, drop or reshape if needed";
enforced by its contract tests). This module builds
INTO the target namespace (``src/ingest/``) by relocating that composing view here and extending
it with exactly the fields the R3 packet asks for and the old view did not yet carry: ``clock_law``
(gridded-ceiling vs station-own-clock — the dichotomy ``_replacement_cycle_availability_poll_if_
needed`` hard-coded per call site instead of declaring), ``dependents`` (the downstream reactions
a source's arrival triggers), and ``fetch_ref`` / ``parse_ref`` / ``clock_check_ref`` (dotted-path
pointers into the existing fetchers — this table does NOT re-implement fetch/parse, it POINTS at
the fetchers that already exist elsewhere, honoring the same "compose, don't duplicate" law).
No compatibility re-export or second contract surface exists.

CLOCK LAW (notepad law, verbatim): station sources (cwa/hko) carry their own provider cycle
clock — they must NEVER be gated behind the gridded freshness ceiling. Concretely:

  * ``"gridded_ceiling"`` — the row's fetch is sequenced behind a shared gridded-model cycle-
    availability probe (``src/data/replacement_cycle_availability.py``): numerical weather
    models publish on a shared ~00Z/06Z/12Z/18Z schedule and the anchor leg's own availability
    gates when the whole basket is safe to fetch.
  * ``"own_clock"`` — the row's ``clock_check`` consults ONLY that source's own cursor / provider
    metadata. Station forecast adapters (``hko_fnd``, ``cwa_township`` — see
    ``src/data/station_forecast_adapter.py``) and every non-forecast family (observation, solar,
    market_topology, ...) fall here: they poll on their own native cadence and must never be
    blocked on another source's gridded-model publish state.

FIVE-CONCERN DISSECTION of ``_replacement_cycle_availability_poll_if_needed`` (src/data/
replacement_forecast_production.py:876-1066) — each incident-patched concern's destination:

  1. Anchor gridded-cycle availability poll + leg fetch (2026-06-11 K4.0b(a))
     -> SourceContract row ``openmeteo_ecmwf_ifs_9km`` (clock_law=gridded_ceiling;
        clock_check_ref -> replacement_cycle_availability.resolve_anchor_cycle_availability;
        fetch_ref -> download_replacement_forecast_current_targets.download_current_target_
        openmeteo_inputs [reference only — that script is HARD-BOUNDARY, not edited]).
  2. Source-clock probe delegation (probe_openmeteo_source_clock_updates call inside the tick)
     -> REDUNDANT under the generic scheduler: this *is* the generic scheduler's own clock_check
        step (src/ingest/scheduler.py:run_source_contract_tick). No separate concern remains once
        a row's clock_check is scheduler-owned; source_clock_update_probe.py's cursor-diff shape
        is what src/ingest/scheduler.py generalizes.
  3. bayes_precision_fusion extras fan-out gate (coverage-probe + fixpoint latch, 2026-06-13/16)
     -> SourceContract row ``bayes_precision_fusion_extras`` (clock_law=gridded_ceiling; its own
        coverage-based clock_check, independent cadence from the anchor leg's cursor).
  4. Fusion-upgrade reseed trigger (Task #32, partial-fusion upgrade detection)
     -> ``dependents`` entry ``"fusion_upgrade_reseed"`` on the ``openmeteo_ecmwf_ifs_9km`` row,
        dispatched by the generic scheduler on ARRIVED (src/data/replacement_fusion_upgrade_
        trigger.enqueue_fusion_upgrade_reseeds).
  5. Cycle-advance rematerialization trigger (U5 step 2a, sister of #4)
     -> ``dependents`` entry ``"cycle_advance_reseed"`` on the ``openmeteo_ecmwf_ifs_9km`` row,
        dispatched by the generic scheduler on ARRIVED (src/data/replacement_cycle_advance_
        trigger.enqueue_cycle_advance_reseeds -- module name inferred from call site; see done-
        claim for the exact function this packet did NOT flip live wiring to call).

SCOPE NOTE: this packet builds and unit-tests the generalized mechanism (this module +
src/ingest/scheduler.py). It deliberately does NOT flip ``_replacement_cycle_availability_poll_
if_needed``'s live call site to the new scheduler — that is a seam transplant on the live
forecast-download path and the rebuild constitution (EXECUTION_MASTER §E2.2) requires replay
evidence before a money-path-adjacent seam flips, which this single packet does not carry. The
mapping above is the destination design; the flip is named as remaining work.
