"""P3 price-channel / CLOB-fact ingest producer logic — lifted out of the order daemon.

This module owns the CLOB-FACT producer that keeps the Polymarket user/market WebSocket
subscribed and durably bridges fills + book facts into the tables the order runtime only
READS (interface I2):

  - the durable fill bridge (``position_current`` / ``position_events`` materialised from
    ``edli_live_order_events`` confirmed fills), and
  - ``execution_feasibility_evidence`` (the pre-submit book witness rows).

WHY IT LIVES HERE (and NOT in src.main) — system_decomposition_plan §4.2/§9:
  - It is ALWAYS_ON (criterion 1): the channel must stay subscribed while trading is
    paused, so fills/book-facts keep flowing even when the order daemon makes no decisions.
  - It owns a DISTINCT external authority (criterion 2): the Polymarket user/market CLOB
    WebSocket stream is its own truth source; the order runtime is a pure CONSUMER.
  - It is FAILURE-DOMAIN-isolated (criterion 3): a WS auth/transport flap must not crash
    the reactor. CRUCIALLY this is also what kills the reduce_only-FOREVER LATCH: the WS
    thread, on auth failure, records a gap in the PROCESS-GLOBAL ``ws_gap_guard`` submit
    latch (``record_gap(AUTH_FAILED)``). When the thread lived in the ORDER DAEMON, that
    record_gap poisoned the same in-memory latch the order daemon's executor reads via
    ``assert_ws_allows_submit`` — the daemon stayed stuck in reduce_only mode forever
    (src/main.py:2610-2622 history). With the thread lifted HERE, its record_gap writes
    only THIS process's ws_gap_guard memory; the order daemon's submit latch is in a
    different address space and can no longer be poisoned by a WS flap. The order daemon
    sees a WS outage only as STALE/ABSENT ``execution_feasibility_evidence`` rows
    (DB-mediated, observable), never as a shared-process exception or a latched gate.

THE DURABLE FILL BRIDGE IS THE PERSISTED TRUTH (system_decomposition_plan §8 Step 3):
  ``_edli_durable_fill_bridge_scan`` re-derives the bridge work set from the persisted
  ``edli_live_order_events`` on EVERY cycle for fills that still have no
  ``position_current`` row, so NO confirmed fill is lost across the conceptual cutover
  from "WS thread in src.main" to "WS thread in P3". Already-materialised historical
  projection repair is an explicit maintenance action, not part of the per-minute live
  hot path, because it can rewrite old rows and contend with fresh book/substrate writes.
  The order-runtime BOOT recovery (``_edli_boot_fill_bridge_recovery``, which STAYS in
  src.main) imports THIS same scan helper so a restart on either side heals any orphaned
  confirmed fill. The scan is the single canonical copy — src.main imports it from here
  (mirroring the P4 pattern ``from src.execution.post_trade_capital import
  _harvester_cycle``).

NO-BACK-COUPLING (system_decomposition_plan §7 I2): P3's trigger is the WS stream + its
  own 1-min reconcile clock. The reactor reads the durable fill bridge; it never signals
  P3. P3 is NEVER gated on the order daemon's queue/flags.

INV-37: the reconcile cycle's fill-bridge cross-DB write (world.edli_live_order_events ->
  trades.position_current/position_events) goes through the sanctioned ATTACH+SAVEPOINT
  path (``get_trade_connection_with_world_required``); no independent cross-DB connection
  is opened.

ALL imports are LAZY (inside functions), exactly as the order daemon kept them, so this
  module's top-level import graph pulls in NO trading lane (src.main / src.engine /
  src.execution / src.strategy / src.signal) — failure-domain isolation (criterion 3).

RE-DECISION ROUTING LIVES ELSEWHERE (R6 split, 2026-07-08 — EXECUTION_MASTER §E R6
  defect #4: "venue does not decide who re-solves"): deciding WHICH money-path families a
  book move should trigger a re-solve for is a decision-layer policy, not a venue-fact-
  bridge fact translation. That routing now lives in
  ``src.events.price_channel_redecision_router``; this module only WIRES its sink in as an
  injected ``market_event_sink`` dependency of ``MarketChannelIngestor`` (still a lazy
  import at each wiring call site — the router module is never imported at load time).
  The pre-split private names are still resolvable as ``price_channel_ingest._edli_X`` /
  ``from src.ingest.price_channel_ingest import _edli_X`` via the module ``__getattr__``
  below, so no external caller (tests included) needed to repoint.

    """MF-1: durable, idempotent, self-healing EDLI fill -> position_current scan.

    THE authoritative bridge trigger (replaces the transient
    ``_edli_fill_bridge_aggregate_ids`` set as the source of truth). Finds every
    aggregate in ``edli_live_order_events`` carrying a ``UserTradeObserved`` with
    ``fill_authority_state == 'FILL_CONFIRMED'`` whose deterministic
    ``edli_bridge_position_id`` has NO ``position_current`` row, and materialises
    each via the idempotent canonical bridge.

    Why this closes the orphan window (the verified DEFECT): the old path only
    bridged aggregates that went PENDING->PROCESSED *this cycle*, holding them in
    an in-memory set. A daemon death OR a swallowed bridge exception between the
    inbox PROCESSED commit and the separate bridge commit left a FILL_CONFIRMED
    aggregate with no position_current row; on restart the set was empty and
    nothing re-bridged it -> capital orphaned. This scan re-derives the work set
    durably from ``edli_live_order_events`` (the persisted truth), so it heals any
    such orphan on the very next cycle AND at boot, regardless of process restarts.

    Idempotency: ``materialize_position_current_from_edli_fill`` upserts
    ``position_current`` (ON CONFLICT(position_id) DO UPDATE) and appends
    ``position_events`` keyed UNIQUE(position_id, sequence_no) — re-bridging an
    already-bridged fill is a no-op for events and a safe UPDATE for the
    projection. The absence filter below ALSO skips already-bridged aggregates so
    a healthy daemon does no redundant work.

    Already-bridged repair is opt-in via ``already_bridged_repair_limit``. The
    per-minute live cycle must stay focused on fresh/orphaned fills; repeatedly
    repairing historical projections can hold the trade DB writer and starve the
    substrate/redecision snapshot path.

    INV-37 / transaction ownership: reads ``edli_live_order_events`` and writes
    ``position_current`` / ``position_events`` ON THE SAME connection ``conn``
    (in production a trade connection with ``world`` ATTACHed). Performs NO
    independent connection and does NOT commit — the caller owns the transaction
    boundary (the cycle / boot wrapper commits once after the scan).

    ``failure_reasons`` is an optional business-liveness sink. The scan remains
    durable and idempotent for boot callers that only need the bridged count;
    the scheduled repair cycle supplies the sink so caught canonical
    materialization failures cannot be reported as healthy.

    Returns the number of orphaned fills bridged this pass.

    the clause is a raw-SQL OR against 'voided' too, so it is left as a
