"""Continuous fill synchronizer: appends venue trade observations, forever.

GROWS existing organs — does not build a parallel pipeline:

  - reads via the EXISTING authenticated ``get_trades(since)``
    (``src.venue.polymarket_v2_adapter.PolymarketV2Adapter.get_trades``);
  - attributes via the EXISTING order_id -> ``venue_commands.venue_order_id``
    join and raw-trade parsing helpers, REUSED (imported, not copied) from
    ``src.execution.exchange_reconcile`` (the module that already does this
    join in its M5 sweep, ``refresh_unresolved_reconcile_findings`` /
    ``run_reconcile_sweep``);
  - writes via the EXISTING ``src.state.venue_command_repo.append_trade_fact``
    (append-only observation log), then invokes command_recovery's canonical
    reducer inside the same transaction. Ingest never duplicates command or
    lifecycle grammar.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (vs. relying on the M5 sweep alone)
------------------------------------------------------------
The M5 sweep (``run_reconcile_sweep`` / ``refresh_unresolved_reconcile_findings``)
is triggered by WS-gap/heartbeat-loss/cutover events and by already-open
findings — it is not a standing, unconditional poller. LX-T4's consult
adjudication requires venue_trade_facts (the sole chain-fact observation log
under the local-ledger excision target shape) to have a source that "SYNCS
CONTINUOUSLY" so a fill landing in the gap between a one-time historical
replay and a reader cutover is still observed (Attack A) — this module is
that continuous poller, scheduled independently of WS health.

FOREIGN FILLS (shared wallet)
-----------------------------
``get_trades()`` returns trades for the WHOLE wallet (shared with the
operator's manual orders — census_chain_sources.md). A trade whose taker/maker
order_id does not resolve to any local ``venue_commands`` row is a foreign
fill: ``append_trade_fact`` requires a non-empty ``command_id`` (its contract
is NOT relaxed here), so a foreign fill cannot be appended to venue_trade_facts
at all — it is counted (``foreign_fill_count``) and skipped there, never
fabricated onto a Zeus command.

DURABLE OBSERVATION LANE (packet I / wave-1.5)
-----------------------------------------------
docs/rebuild/local_ledger_excision_2026-07-12.md §KEEP-spine 完备性补遗
("归属图+歧义证据 — foreign/ambiguous 留 observation 不丢") requires foreign and
ambiguous fills to be durably retained, not merely counted and dropped —
``get_trades()`` re-serving full history today is not a durability guarantee
for tomorrow. Every swept trade — Zeus-attributed, foreign, or ambiguous — is
therefore appended to ``wallet_fill_observations`` FIRST, before the
Zeus-attributed lane below runs. See
``src.state.schema.wallet_fill_observations_schema`` for the table contract
(disposition enum, immutability/no-delete triggers, idempotency key).

DURABLE COVERAGE WATERMARK
---------------------------
``get_trades()`` today returns ALL currently-visible trades on every call (no
server-side pagination cursor — see ``PolymarketV2Adapter.get_trades``, which
accepts ``since`` but does not forward it to the SDK). Absence-safety
therefore comes from two independent mechanisms, not from windowing alone:

  1. every fetched trade is checked against ``venue_trade_facts`` for an
     already-recorded identical revision (idempotent re-append rejected);
  2. ``fill_sync_watermarks`` records the wall-clock time of the last fully
     persisted sync cycle (a coverage-completeness proof, not a hard
     resumption cursor — there is nothing to resume when every cycle already
     scans everything). ``since`` is still passed to ``get_trades`` so a
     future SDK/venue surface that adds real windowing is honored for free.

The watermark row is only written AFTER the whole batch's ``append_trade_fact``
calls have succeeded (advance-after-persist). Offline ``sync_fills`` remains one
atomic transaction. The live writer commits bounded idempotent tranches so a
MONITOR waiter can acquire between them; a later failure leaves the watermark
unchanged and the next cycle safely replays the full scan.
