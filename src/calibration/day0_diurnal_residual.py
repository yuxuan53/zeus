"""Station diurnal-residual nowcast for the Day0 entry lane (read-only, fail-open).

WHAT IT MODELS. On the target day our posterior conditions on the running observed
extreme but treats the remaining NWP path as near-certain, so it is overconfident on
the running-extreme ("floor") bin before the diurnal peak: at local hours 08-11 with
the peak 0-1h away a stated q_floor of 0.90-0.95 realises 0.31. This module carries the
empirical distribution of the residual

    D = final_extreme - running_extreme        (absorbing direction; D >= 0)

as counts per (metric, k = hours-to-peak, NWP-gap band) and per (metric, city, k),
Empirical-Bayes shrunk pooled -> gap cell -> city cell with prior weight 25 and a +0.5
Laplace floor on the pooled histogram.

WHY A VETO AND NOT A q. Walk-forward on identical candidate (slice, bin) pairs the
nowcast's executable edge beats our posterior's (+0.028 vs +0.017 per unit on HIGH),
but its Brier is significantly WORSE than the market's at every hour (0.2097 vs 0.1051,
CI [-0.1445, -0.0573]). It is a better filter than us and a worse forecaster than the
book, so the only sound wiring is to refuse the trades it disagrees with. The set "our
model would trade, the nowcast vetoes" is -0.020/unit HIGH [-0.040, -0.001] and
-0.043/unit LOW, negative in 6/6 out-of-sample windows.

WALK-FORWARD AT SERVE TIME. The study filtered every histogram to station-days
strictly before the target date at query time. Here that filter is baked into the
artifact instead: the fitter drops every record whose date is >= its ``fit_date``, so a
decision made on day T reads counts assembled only from days before the last refit.
Serving therefore does no date filtering at all — and MUST not, because the artifact
cannot distinguish a record it kept from one it should have dropped. The freshness gate
below is what keeps ``fit_date`` close enough to T for that to be a real bound rather
than a stale one.

FAIL-OPEN IS THE WHOLE CONTRACT. Missing artifact, malformed artifact, artifact older
than MAX_ARTIFACT_AGE_DAYS, unknown city, unit disagreement, anchor absent, empty cell
-- every one returns None and the gate above stays inert. The artifact's PRESENCE is
the switch; there is no config flag. This module never raises into the decision path
and never reads a database.
