# Last reused/audited: 2026-08-21
# Authority basis (2026-06-12 external deep-review): registered TRANSIENT money-path
#   reason bases LIVE_DEPTH_AUTHORITY_MISSING (FINDING-A taker-depth twin-authority),
#   BANKROLL_FREE_CASH_MISSING (FINDING-B free-cash bound under injected provider) and
#   QLCB_COVERAGE_AUTHORITY_FAULT (FINDING-C settlement-coverage shrinker fail-closed)
#   for the event_reactor_adapter fail-closed fixes.
# Authority basis (2026-06-11 operator follow-up): (a) SOURCE_TRUTH intake gate
#   defers to the serving authority — coverage PARTIAL/BLOCKED passes through,
#   dead-letter only for junk run identity (twin-authority #8, 16:33:51Z six-city
#   incident); (b) price-race aborts (SUBMIT_ABORTED_PRICE_MOVED, would_cross_book
#   certificate failure) classify TRANSIENT → bounded requeue (Miami/NYC 16:22Z);
#   (c) pre-event cycle-budget check caps overrun to one in-flight event;
#   (d) claim-storm kill (17:51Z): Window A BEGIN IMMEDIATE (busy handler engaged
#   deterministically, BUSY_SNAPSHOT category closed), lock-bounce rollback +
#   claim_lock_bounces visibility, pre-fetch dangling-txn guard. Root cause was
#   main._edli_pending_entity_keys leaking PRAGMA busy_timeout=250 onto the
#   shared claim conn (now save/restore-scoped).
# Prior: #95 SEV-2.1 — world_write_mutex MUST NOT be held across the
#   injected submit callable's network I/O (JIT /book HTTP fetch + venue order
#   POST). _process_event_unit split into two committed world-DB write windows
#   around the network submit boundary; contract is db.py world_write_lock /
#   world_write_mutex ("never hold across HTTP") + INV-37.
#   P1 ZERO-SUBMIT FIX B (2026-06-05, iron-rule-1, co-cause): _finalize_reservation
#   commits/rolls back the adapter's PROVISIONAL per-cycle in-flight reservation
#   so a candidate rejected downstream of Kelly (DECISION_CERTIFICATE /
#   EXECUTOR_EXPRESSIBILITY) never inflates corr/raw committed for later
#   same-cycle candidates (INV-K7 preserved for emitted bets).
#   MAJOR #5 (2026-06-05): the network-submit ``except`` now also rolls back the
#   provisional reservation (_finalize_reservation emitted=False) so a _submit
#   that raises AFTER reserve() — mid-submit DB/HTTP fault — cannot orphan a live
#   reservation that over-counts committed for the next same-cycle event.

    BACKGROUND-I/O TIME BUDGET, not a money-path cap. The drain refreshes the
    executable-snapshot substrate for EVERY family blocked this cycle; with ~49
    blocked families that is ~49 /book network fetches per cycle, which is the
    cycle-overrun root cause (#83 redecide_block_2026-06-16 §3): the reactor is
    APScheduler-scheduled every 60s but the cycle wall-time blows past 60s, so the
    schedule COALESCES into 3-13 min real gaps → ~1 family decided per cycle → the
    49-city harvest crosses far too slowly for continuous fills.

    SCHEDULE MATH (justifies the 10.0s default): the reactor runs on an
    ``interval, minutes=1`` job (``src/main.py:9486``, 60s). The per-cycle DECISION
    budget is 30s (``_cycle_budget_seconds`` / ``ZEUS_REACTOR_CYCLE_BUDGET_SECONDS``).
    A 10s drain budget gives 30s decision + 10s drain = 40s, leaving ~20s headroom

    teardown — so the whole cycle fits inside the 60s schedule with margin and the

    ``ZEUS_REACTOR_REFRESH_BUDGET_SECONDS`` (default 17.0s inside a 20s interval,
    ``src/main.py:3504``): a wall-clock budget on background substrate I/O.

    When the budget is spent the drain STOPS after finishing the current family
    (never mid-network) and leaves the unreached families in ``_pending_*`` for the
    NEXT cycle; the drain's fair-cursor rotation (held-position families always
    first, then round-robin) guarantees bounded-cycle coverage with no starvation —
    exactly the "future per-cycle fan-out cap" the drain ordering comment already

    decisions, and in the live degenerate case where ONE decision eats the whole 45s
    budget, effectively ~1) the day0 lane consumes the whole budget and the
    forecast/spine harvest lane is never processed. This interleaves the two DECISION

    2026-06-16: 176 FORECAST_SNAPSHOT_READY families sat attempt_count=0 (never claimed)
    while the reactor claimed ~2 day0 families/cycle, because day0 held the first slot
    and a single slow day0 decision exhausted the 45s budget before the alternation ever
    reached a forecast family (processed=0 forecast decisions / 12min). When the budget
    only completes ~1 decision, whichever lane holds the first slot is the ONLY lane that

    scanned-but-never-claimed event, e.g. a claim-lock bounce, must not drain
    the loop's event-count budget every time it gets rescanned in a later
    epoch).

    ``submitted`` is whether this epoch placed a venue order
    (``GlobalBatchSubmitResult.venue_submit_count == 1``) — the multi-winner
    loop's natural, no-caps terminator: an epoch with no positive winner is

    loop must stop (docs/operations/current/plans/
    auction_multiwinner_plan_2026-07-19.md §4.1).

    ``finalized`` is True only when the epoch's winner (if any) had its
    world-side disposition committed WITHOUT ERROR by
    ``_finalize_deferred_event_unit`` — a Window-B lock/requeue failure (the
    winner event goes back to PENDING, not durable) or an unexpected

    failure, since neither leaves epoch K's authoritative winner disposition
    durable as the loop's continuation claim requires. ``finalized`` is
    vacuously True when the epoch had no winner (``submitted`` is already
    False in that case, so it does not gate anything).

    ``claimed_event_ids`` is the set of events this epoch actually claimed (a
    subset of the scanned events) — see ``attempted``.

    ``auction_completed_non_cancelled`` copies the opaque adapter's explicit
    ``economic_cut_completed`` disposition. It is never inferred from receipt

        EDLI live-probe contention fix (2026-05-31): the EDLI reactor and the
        market-channel ingestor are two in-process WAL writers on zeus-world.db.
        Each event's world WRITE UNIT (claim → ledger writes → mark → commit) is
        serialized against the ingestor via the process-global world-DB write
        mutex (``world_write_mutex`` in db.py). Without it a contended write waited
        out the 30 s busy_timeout → "database is locked" → the reactor cycle
        hung/skipped (status=FAILED).

        SEV-2.1 split (2026-06-01): the injected ``self._submit`` callable performs
        NETWORK I/O — the JIT ``/book`` HTTP fetch (main._edli_pre_submit_jit_book_
        quote_provider) and the venue order POST (executor). Holding the world
        mutex AND an open world-DB transaction (the WAL write lock, opened by
        ``claim()``) across that I/O serialized every world write behind slow
        network calls → WAL lock starvation. The contract on ``world_write_lock`` /
        ``world_write_mutex`` (db.py) is explicit: NEVER hold across HTTP. We honour
        it by evaluating read-only gates before taking the writer, committing
        the pre-submit world write unit (claim + verdict writes), and releasing
        the mutex BEFORE the network submit, running
        ``self._submit`` with NO mutex and NO open world txn, then re-acquiring the
        mutex for a SECOND world write unit (post-submit ledger writes + mark).

        Per-window ``_commit_event_unit`` commits so the WAL write lock is released
        between windows (and between events) and the ingestor gets frequent write
        windows. ``fetch_pending`` (a read) stays OUTSIDE the lock.

            NOT inflate corr_committed_usd / raw_committed_usd for later

        EDLI live-probe contention fix (2026-05-31): the reactor and the
        market-channel ingestor are two in-process writers on the same WAL
        zeus-world.db. Previously the reactor opened one implicit DEFERRED
        transaction at the first ``claim()`` and held the single WAL *write* lock
        for the WHOLE cycle (~330 s, incl. HTTP submit work), committing only at
        cycle end. The ingestor thread then blocked the full 30 s busy_timeout on
        every write → "database is locked" → the reactor cycle hung/skipped.

        Committing PER EVENT releases the WAL write lock between events so the
        ingestor (and any other world writer) gets frequent windows to write,
        instead of waiting out a cycle-long lock. The process-global world-DB
        write mutex (``world_write_lock`` in db.py) additionally guarantees the
        two threads never hold the SQLite write lock concurrently, so a contended
        write waits cleanly on the Python mutex rather than crashing on a
        busy_timeout "database is locked".

        Real sqlite3 connections implement ``.commit()``; test doubles may not, so
        we tolerate AttributeError. Failure-soft: a commit error here is logged by
        the caller's exception path (the savepoint write already succeeded; the

    thin delegating call.

    Cut 10 wires daemon scheduling and schema/config readiness. The live-money
    submit adapter still uses injected gates; until an event is explicitly
    accepted by those gates, this job is conservative and side-effect free.

    ``active_lock`` is the ``threading.Lock`` main.py calls
    ``_edli_reactor_active_lock``, injected from src.main: it is a cross-job
    scheduling-coordination primitive (5+ other EDLI jobs read its
    ``.locked()`` state), so main.py -- the dispatcher -- retains ownership
    of the Lock object itself. This cycle owns the acquire/release lifecycle
    around its own run, exactly as it did before the extraction.

    ``urgent_day0_pending`` is the dispatcher's cross-thread signal for a
    newly committed observation. Lower-priority producer batches consult it
    only between durable event units; the Day0 batch itself is never cancelled.

    ``held_position_monitor_pending`` is the typed periodic-monitor handoff
    signal. It may cancel one in-flight auction; that cancellation reserves the
    next global auction against further periodic-monitor cancellation until it
    completes, so neither lane can starve the other. Urgent forecast and Day0
    monitors do not consume this fairness token. Newly committed Day0 facts
    retain their independent urgent cancellation path inside the live adapter.

    ``held_position_monitor_debt_pending`` remains set after a handoff timeout.
    Unlike the transient handoff signal, it also cancels an already-reserved
    completion auction so an in-flight selection cannot outlive monitor debt.

    ``allow_paused_forecast_snapshot_completion`` is qualified once by
    ``src.main`` from durable global entries-pause state. It applies only to
    the selected no-submit forecast carrier's overlapping forecast wakes;
    Day0, fills, held SELL completion, and unknown wakes still cancel it.

    GATE #84 root cause: the shared market-channel feasibility feed stamps
    ``quote_seen_at`` with the venue book-CHANGE timestamp (1s resolution, often
    minutes stale for slow weather books), and only refreshes a given token when
    its WS tick arrives (median per-candidate gap ~11s). The 1000ms pre-submit
    bound is a SUBMIT-TIME observation-freshness bound, so for the one selected
    candidate we pull its live book ``now`` and anchor freshness to OUR
    observation time — the FOK crosses against exactly this book.

    Returns ``(best_bid, best_ask, book_hash, observed_at, authority_id)`` on a
    usable executable book, or ``None`` only when the fetch itself fails. The
    caller treats that as a hard no-submit: cached feasibility rows cannot prove
    submit-time truth. For a taker limit intent, ``size`` is ConditionalToken
    shares, so the same JIT response must cover that share count at prices within

    Reads cached beliefs (world, RO) × freshest executable prices (trade, RO), runs the cheap edge
    screen, and ENQUEUES EDLI_REDECISION_PENDING events for families whose edge fired — so the
    reactor re-decides on PRICE movement between forecast cycles (the ~5-6h cadence gap the operator
    flagged). ALSO screens OPEN maker rests (§4.5): a rest whose belief decayed on new evidence, or
    whose book moved/went stale, is pulled (re-decide at fresh price) — the fix for "submitted then
    abandoned" (Busan/Beijing). NO new HTTP: reads only what the warm/fast lanes already persisted;
    the actual cancel reuses the shared venue-cancel-journal path. Fail-soft: never crashes
    the scheduler.

    Wave-1 2026-06-12: the redecision_screen_enabled gate is DELETED. The screen is the
    fill-rate ORGAN, not an optional feature — it now runs whenever the reactor is LIVE and
    event writing is enabled (the same arm conditions that license the reactor itself). Data
    + cancel only; no new submit authority of its own.

    R4-b4 (2026-07-08 main.py slimming): thin scheduler hook extracted. ``screen_lock``
    is the ``threading.Lock`` main.py calls ``_edli_redecision_screen_lock``, injected
    from src.main: it is a cross-job scheduling-coordination primitive (settlement
    attribution and the day0-hourly-refresh cluster also read its ``.locked()`` state),
    so main.py -- the dispatcher -- retains ownership of the Lock object itself. This
    cycle owns the acquire/release lifecycle around its own run, exactly as it did before
    the extraction. ``_edli_redecision_acted_state`` is reach-back-imported rather than
    injected: it is a plain mutable dict with no acquire/release lifecycle, and the
    out-of-scope command-recovery cluster still mutates it directly in main.py, so the
    reach-back import just binds the same live object reference -- no duplication.

# R4-b4 (2026-07-08 main.py slimming): pre-submit-JIT warm-CLOB-client cluster,
# extracted from src/main.py's book/warmup timeout helpers, the
# _PRE_SUBMIT_JIT_CLOB_CLIENT singleton (construct/reset), the prewarm helper,
# and the keepalive-pinger scheduler job. main.py's scheduler hook is now a
# thin delegating call. R4-b3 already moved this cluster's consumer --
# _edli_pre_submit_jit_book_quote_provider below -- and at the time kept the
# singleton in main.py because it was shared with this pinger; now that the
# pinger has moved too, every consumer of the singleton lives in this module,
# so the former reach-back import in that function is deleted below.
# _edli_pre_submit_clob_timeout_seconds is still reach-back-imported from
# main.py: it is genuinely used broadly outside this cluster (three other
# reach-back sites already in this module).

    the outer daemon guard (the 2026-06-19 invariant). httpcore applies the connect
    timeout to ``connect_tcp`` AND ``start_tls`` separately, so the worst-case connect
    cost is ``2*connect``; bound ``2*connect + read + write + pool`` strictly under the
    outer guard. With outer=6.0 this yields connect≈2.25 (worst case 2*2.25+0.85+0.25+
    0.10 = 5.70 < 6.0). This connect budget is a FAIL-CLOSED bound, not the normal
    path — the boot pre-warm + keepalive pinger keep the socket warm so the submit-time
    fetch reuses an established connection (~0.66s, measured forward 2026-06-22) and
    does not pay a cold handshake here. Cold handshakes (~2.2-2.7s) are absorbed by the
