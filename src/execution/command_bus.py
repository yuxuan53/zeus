"""Venue command bus — typed surface for the durable command journal.

Pure type contract. No I/O, no DB, no side effects. P1.S3 wires the executor
to write through `src/state/venue_command_repo.py` using these types.

Public surface:
    CommandState           — closed command-side state enum
    CommandEventType       — closed command-side event enum
    IntentKind             — enum, 4 closed intent kinds
    IdempotencyKey         — frozen value object with deterministic factory
    VenueCommand           — frozen dataclass mirroring the venue_commands row
    TERMINAL_STATES        — frozenset of states from which no entry/fill events fire
    IN_FLIGHT_STATES       — frozenset of states the recovery loop must scan

Grammar guarantees (INV-29):
    - All enums are closed `str, Enum` types — `CommandState("BANANA")` raises ValueError.
    - VenueCommand is `dataclass(frozen=True)` — mutation raises FrozenInstanceError.
    - IdempotencyKey.from_inputs is deterministic: same inputs across separate
      Python processes produce byte-identical key strings.
