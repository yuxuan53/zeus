# Created: 2026-05 (R3 M5)

# Authority basis (operator external-close incident chain 2026-06-10): the operator
#   manually SOLD Zeus's position on the SHARED proxy wallet. When the order FILLED the
#   void-misbooking double-counted the same 66.25 economic claim (journal buy-claim +
#   voided-position terminal-holdings = expected_wallet 132.50 vs exchange 0), so
#   position_drift re-recorded forever. The K=1 absorption (a) books the external close
#   as a SELL exit fact consuming the journal buy-claim and (b) tags the dangling
#   terminal position chain_state=external_operator_closed so the closed-holdings view
#   stops contributing it. STRICTLY gated on an operator-acknowledged resolution row for
#   the SAME subject token. See _absorb_operator_external_close.
# Authority basis (2026-06-10 operator-acknowledged ghost antibody): an in-Zeus-domain
#   resting order the operator manually placed on the SHARED proxy wallet and
#   explicitly acknowledged (a prior finding resolved_by 'session_operator_confirmed'
#   or resolution prefix 'operator_manual') is record-and-resolved while unfilled
#   (size_matched == 0), so one acknowledged unwind cannot freeze the engine via the
#   risk_allocator reconcile_finding_threshold or the WS two-proofs M5 zero-findings
#   latch. Any matched size voids the acknowledgment (fail-closed, mirrors the
#   foreign-wallet matched-size tripwire). See _is_operator_acknowledged_resting_order.
# Authority basis: R3 M5 reconcile + 2026-06-04 M5 mutex-IO antibody. The adapter-
#   touching entrypoints (fresh_reconcile_snapshot, run_reconcile_sweep) assert
#   the world write mutex is NOT held before any venue read, so a future caller
#   that holds the lock across the reconcile sweep fails loud (WorldMutexIOViolation)
#   at the reconcile boundary instead of wedging the daemon (STEP-7 / #95 disease).
#   2026-06-09 foreign-wallet classification: the wallet is NOT exclusively Zeus's —
#   the operator places manual orders on the same proxy wallet (observed: 6 LIVE GTC
#   orders on AI-themed markets tripping reconcile_finding_threshold and freezing all
#   Zeus entries). A resting, zero-fill venue order on a market entirely outside
#   Zeus's domain (never in executable_market_snapshots NOR venue_commands) cannot be
#   a lost Zeus side effect; it is recorded for audit and immediately resolved instead
#   of arming the kill switch. Any matched size or any Zeus-domain market keeps the
#   strict fail-closed ghost path (credential-compromise tripwire intact).
"""R3 M5 exchange reconciliation sweep.

This module reconciles read-only exchange observations against Zeus's durable
venue-command/fact journal.  It is intentionally not an execution actuator:
exchange-only state becomes an ``exchange_reconcile_findings`` row, not a new
``venue_commands`` row, and no live venue submit/cancel/redeem side effects are
performed here.

LOCK DISCIPLINE (2026-06-04): the venue reads here (``get_open_orders`` /
``get_trades`` / ``get_positions`` / per-order ``get_order``) are BLOCKING
network/on-chain I/O.  The runtime callers pre-capture those surfaces OFF any
DB write lock via ``fresh_reconcile_snapshot`` and then reconcile against the
immutable snapshot, so no venue read happens while the zeus-world.db write
mutex is held.  The ``assert_no_world_mutex_held_for_io`` guard at the
adapter-touching entrypoints enforces that discipline structurally.

# ---- Operator external-close absorption (the variant-3 antibody) ----------------------
#
# 2026-06-10 incident chain: the operator manually SOLD Zeus's Milan position on the
# shared proxy wallet. While the order rested -> ghost suppression (works). When it
# FILLED -> position_drift (correct). chain_sync then VOIDED the position, but the void
# created a "terminal_position_current_chain_holdings" entry (66.25) WITHOUT consuming the
# journal buy-claim (66.25) with an offsetting sell fact. The drift detector's
# expected_wallet then DOUBLE-COUNTS the same 66.25 economic claim (journal 66.25 +
# closed-holdings 66.25 = 132.50) vs exchange 0 -> position_drift re-records forever.
#
# K=1 mechanism (make the CATEGORY impossible, not the instance): when a position's
# tokens leave the wallet via an OPERATOR-CONFIRMED external fill, converge the books by
#   (a) booking the external close as an exit FACT (a SELL venue_trade_fact, size = the
#       journal's net long, price = the operator's documented limit, price_basis=
#       operator_limit) that CONSUMES the journal buy-claim -> journal nets to 0; and
#   (b) tagging the dangling terminal position's chain_state EXTERNAL_OPERATOR_CLOSED so
#       the closed-position-holdings view (which assumes tokens are still on-chain) no
#       longer contributes that 66.25 -> single-count.
# After absorption expected_wallet == 0 == exchange -> no finding on re-sweep.
#
# STRICTNESS (mirrors the operator-acknowledged-ghost antibody): absorption requires an
# operator-acknowledged RESOLUTION row for the SAME subject token (resolved_by LIKE
# 'session_operator_confirmed%' OR resolution LIKE 'operator_manual%'). Never automatic
# for unexplained drifts — an unacknowledged drift stays fail-closed and arms the latch.

    Three independent signals route to the SAME finding kind
    ``collateral_identity_mismatch``:

    1. Orphan sweep: a live (unreleased, unconverted) reservation attached to
       a terminal venue_commands row — the terminalization-centrality seam
       (append_event) was bypassed for that command.
    2. Stuck unsettled row: an unsettled OUTGOING_DEDUCTION/INCOMING_PROCEEDS
       row older than COLLATERAL_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE_SECONDS that a newer balance
       snapshot (captured_at > created_at + CLOCK_SKEW) has already had the
       chance to clear but did not — the clearing rule failed to fire. Rows
       younger than the tolerance are excluded (expected venue lag, not a
       mismatch — false-RED protection, critic ruling 4).
    3. Reconstruction went negative: the type-aware spendable_pusd identity
       must hold EXACTLY by construction (the CAS trigger enforces it at
       insert time); a negative value can only mean some writer bypassed the
       CAS path. Defense in depth.

    Auto-resolve (critic ruling 4): callers should invoke this on every clean
    check; if the previous check's findings are absent this time, resolve them
    via resolve_finding(resolution='auto_clean_recheck') so a transient
    mismatch never becomes a sticky halt.

    """Recognize a terminal-chain-closed swept-winner phantom from evidence in hand.

    K=1 (make the CATEGORY impossible, not the instance): the operator's standing
    third-party auto-redeemer sweeps every settled winner off the shared wallet. After
    the sweep the venue reports exchange size 0, while a terminal local position
    (phase voided/settled/admin_closed, chain_state synced/exit_pending_missing — the
    closed-position-holdings view) still asserts an expected on-chain CTF holding. That
    dangling terminal-holding double-counts against a venue-zero balance and re-records
    position_drift forever, freezing the M5 submit latch.

    The settled-external absorber (task #31, _market_calendar_terminal_evidence) recognizes
    this only via the calendar AND only once the market's target local day is >= 24h past,
    AND it lived ONLY on the 1-minute refresh path — never on the full sweep that
    run_ws_gap_reconcile_and_clear actually runs. The 2026-06-13 Denver freeze fell in both
    gaps: the full-sweep path had no settled absorber at all, so the phantom (5bbc2be2) was
    re-recorded every sweep and the latch stayed frozen.

    This absorber closes both gaps. It runs on BOTH paths, and it pairs TWO independent
    terminal signals so it stays strictly fail-closed:
      (1) ON-CHAIN terminal close: venue size 0 against a terminal (voided/settled/
          admin_closed) chain-holding row, no live sell lock — the tokens are provably gone
          from the wallet; AND
      (2) MARKET settledness: the token's market is calendar-terminal (its target local day
          has ENDED — buffer_hours=0, because signal (1) already proves the tokens left, so
          the venue-lag margin the +24h buffer guards against is redundant).

    Requiring (2) is what distinguishes a SETTLED-winner sweep (market resolved; the
    third-party redeemer claimed it) from an OPERATOR-MANUAL open-market sale (market still
    open — no calendar evidence). The latter has no ``settled_terminal`` and stays
    fail-closed on the strict operator-ack path. (See test_reconcile_operator_external_close:
    its ``condition-m5`` market is absent from the registry, so settled_terminal is None.)

    On match: register token_suppression('settled_position') with terminal-close evidence so
    the suppression door (_token_is_suppressed_external) keeps it resolved on every future
    sweep. Idempotent (the suppression door short-circuits the next sweep). Books NO synthetic
    money: settlement P&L stays with the settlement organs and the Confirm-pending-deposit
    check; only the drift/latch accounting is corrected.

    only through the condition bridge. FAIL-CLOSED: registry unreadable, token unmatched,
    or timezone unknown -> the token is simply not classified terminal (the drift finding
    stays open and the operator-ack path remains the only door).

    ``buffer_hours`` is the venue-lag safety margin the calendar absorber adds before a
    market-day-end alone is trusted as terminal. The terminal-chain-closed-phantom absorber
    passes ``buffer_hours=0``: when the on-chain terminal close is ALSO proven (venue 0 vs a
    terminal voided/settled chain-holding), the venue-lag margin is redundant — the chain has
    already proven the tokens are gone, so day-end is sufficient.

    Read-only, short-lived connection (three-phase contract: no connection outlives the
    lookup, nothing is held across any other I/O).

    ONLY by the on-chain CTF balance — the chain reconciler (src/state/chain_reconciliation
