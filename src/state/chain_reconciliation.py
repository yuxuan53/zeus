# rows MUST filter on authority = LEARNING_AUTHORITY_REQUIRED to avoid silently
# misclassifying legacy / placeholder / quarantine-default rows (which are

# evidence. The relationship test in
# tests/test_authority_strict_learning.py scans the repo for SELECT-side
# reads of rescue_events_v2 and asserts each carries this filter.
#
# Antibody scope (post-review honesty, code-reviewer fix#4): the scanner is
# LOOSE — it accepts any `WHERE authority = ?` clause, including hardcoded
# "VERIFIED" string literals that bypass this constant. A future consumer
# can satisfy the antibody without importing LEARNING_AUTHORITY_REQUIRED.
# This is intentional: requiring the import would be a stronger antibody
# but would also reject legitimate diagnostic / one-off audit reads. Code
# reviewers reading new SELECT-from-rescue_events_v2 sites should verify
# the literal matches this constant value.

    """Peer of resolve_rescue_authority for non-rescue position-metric reads.

    Slice P2-C1 (PR #19 phase 2, 2026-04-26): consolidates the 4 silent-
    HIGH defaults at lifecycle_events.py:100, monitor_refresh.py:140/298/334
    into one helper that preserves UNVERIFIED authority tagging.

    Pre-P2-C1, those sites used `getattr(position, "temperature_metric",
    "high")` which silently substituted HIGH for missing metric WITHOUT
    informing downstream consumers. monitor_refresh.py:140 was the most
    severe case — passing the silent HIGH directly into get_calibrator,
    undermining Phase 9C L3's metric-aware calibrator gate at the entry
    seam (a LOW position with missing metric received the HIGH Platt
    model silently).

    Return shape mirrors resolve_rescue_authority exactly so analytics
    consumers can apply the same authority='VERIFIED' filter pattern.
    Emits a DEBUG log when the UNVERIFIED default fires so operators can
    audit which positions are being defaulted.

    Returns:
        (metric, authority, source)
        - metric: str — "high" or "low" (always in domain; defaults to "high"
          for backward compat with legacy positions whose metric was never set).

          (high|low) value; "UNVERIFIED" otherwise.
