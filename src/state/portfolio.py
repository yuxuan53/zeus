"""Portfolio state management. Spec §6.4.

Atomic JSON + SQL mirror. Positions are projection-cache adapters; canonical
truth is `position_events` + `position_current` (see PR #352, F1 in
docs/archive/2026-Q2/findings_historical/findings_2026_05_28.md). The `Position` dataclass is a runtime view that
combines submitted-intent economics, verified fill economics, and chain-
observed economics into a single object — but each economics object has its
own authority field on `position_current` and event payloads. The legacy
``entry_price`` / ``cost_basis_usd`` / ``size_usd`` / ``shares`` attributes
remain as derived/compatibility views and MUST NOT be mutated by chain-
balance rescue after F1: balance-only rescue writes the chain aggregate into
``chain_avg_price`` / ``chain_cost_basis_usd`` / ``chain_shares`` only.

Provides exposure queries for risk limit enforcement.

        every executable cumulative prefix: walk the held-side bid ladder best-first
        and append ``(x, L(x))`` after each positive rung up to the holding.
        Proceeds are NEVER extrapolated past visible depth — the unfillable remainder
        (held − x_fill) is held on BOTH sides of predicted_bin_law's comparison
        ((held−x)·q⁻ + L(x) vs held·q⁻) and cancels, so pricing the fillable prefix
        against holding that same prefix is the true all-or-nothing comparison. Pricing
        the whole position at the top bid (the prior law) overstated proceeds whenever
        depth < held and manufactured false SELL dominance many multiples of the
        one-tick hysteresis margin (100 held with a 0.30×10 / 0.20×90 book: the old
        law priced $30, the true fillable value is ~$21).

        Fallback chain: no ladder but a known top-of-book size → a single rung capped
        at min(held, bid_size); no depth info at all → the legacy uncapped single rung
        (held·(bid − fee)), preserving behavior for depth-blind callers/tests. No
        finite bid → empty curve → the law holds (except under RED). The fee is per
        rung, exactly as before. The paid entry price is sunk and never enters here.

    `position_events` row, which violated the "append before projection

    callers wishing to overlay chain-derived economics MUST construct

    Task #107 (portfolio/multi Kelly), design §3(a) — the SINGLE structural

    exposure". The live EDLI reactor then sizes the new bet against
    ``effective_bankroll(B, this)`` so simultaneous fractional-Kelly stakes
    can never sum past ``B·f_cap``.

    Computes ``Σ_i  effective_cost_basis_usd(p_i) · get_correlation(new_city,
    p_i.city)`` over all runtime-open positions, PLUS the same-cycle
    ``extra_reserved`` ``(city, usd)`` tuples weighted identically. Reuses the
    existing primitives verbatim (no parallel system — iron rule 4):

      - ``get_open_positions`` / ``_is_runtime_open_position`` — the open set.
      - ``_runtime_open_exposure_usd`` — per-position committed USD
        (``effective_cost_basis_usd``; 0.0 for pending-without-fill).
      - ``get_correlation`` (correlation.py) — pairwise city correlation in
        [0,1]; self-correlation (same city, e.g. a sibling MECE bin) = 1.0, so
        same-family bins are summed at FULL weight (MECE-safe — competing
        partitions of one event are never sized as independent bets).
        Distant cities decay to the 0.10 haversine floor.

    ``extra_reserved`` carries the same-cycle in-flight reservations (INV-K7):
    a just-emitted EDLI entry is ``PENDING_TRACKED`` without fill authority, so
    its ``effective_cost_basis_usd`` is 0.0 and it is invisible to
    ``load_portfolio()`` until reconciled. The reactor accumulates each
    accepted Kelly stake as a ``(city, usd)`` reservation and passes it here so
    the next same-cycle bet nets it — otherwise the intra-cycle budget is
    breached.

    Returns a non-negative USD figure. Never amplifies anything downstream:
    ``effective_bankroll`` only ever subtracts this from the bankroll.
