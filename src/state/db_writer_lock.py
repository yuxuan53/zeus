"""SQLite writer-lock helpers — Phase 0 of v4 plan.

Phase 0 lands the helper surface only. No production caller is migrated by
this module. Callers retain their existing get_*_connection() routes; the
helpers here will be threaded through in Phase 1+.

Key components:
  * `WriteClass` — LIVE / BULK enum
  * `db_writer_lock(db_path, write_class)` — fcntl.flock context manager,
    one of six lock files (3 DBs x 2 classes). Per plan §3.1.2.
  * `BulkChunker` — context-managed cooperative chunker for BULK writes
    with dual-channel (cooperative flag + interrupt_main) watchdog. Per
    plan §3.1.5 (resolves v3-critic MF5 critical bug).
  * `subprocess_with_write_class()` / `subprocess_run_with_write_class()`
    — spawn helpers that propagate ZEUS_DB_WRITE_CLASS env-var. Per plan
    §3.1.7 (resolves v3-critic AX1).

NOT in Phase 0:
  * Production callers are not retrofitted (Phase 1+).
  * `get_connection()` reclassification (Phase 1+).
  * Subprocess sites enumeration / replacement (Phase 1.y).
  * §3.4 production flag flip (Phase 3.x).

    """Schedule ``func`` on ``scheduler`` with a per-job write_class.

    v4 plan §10.4: every scheduled job that ultimately writes to a Zeus DB
    must carry an explicit write_class so the connection helpers
    (db.py::_connect / get_connection / ...) can route the job onto the
    correct flock. This wrapper:

    1. Resolves ``write_class`` via the same precedence as
       ``db._resolve_write_class()`` (explicit kwarg > env > default),
       defaulting to BULK because the dominant ingest jobs are BULK.
    2. Wraps ``func`` so the resolved class is exported to the
       ``ZEUS_DB_WRITE_CLASS`` env var for the duration of the job
       invocation (thread-local-restoration semantics: the prior value is
       snapshotted on enter and restored on exit, so concurrent threadpool
       jobs do not stomp each other if one runs without an explicit
       class).
    3. Delegates to ``scheduler.add_job(wrapped, *args, **kwargs)`` and
       returns whatever the underlying scheduler returns.

    The wrapper is APScheduler-compatible (the scheduler is duck-typed:
    any object with an ``add_job(func, *args, **kwargs)`` method works,
    so test doubles do not need APScheduler installed).

    Phase 0.5 lands the helper; the ingest_main.py / main.py call-site
    retrofit is part of Phase 1+.
