"""Value-tiered persistence for executable market snapshots.

The full executable snapshot table is the U1 bridge from discovery facts to
command submission. Rows are immutable: a later market read appends a new
snapshot_id; it never edits evidence a prior venue_command cited. Broad
discovery also has a separate compact, append-only time-series that is never
valid command/submit evidence.

# This table is APPEND-ONLY by DB trigger (NC-NEW-B):
# no_update_executable_market_snapshots / no_delete_executable_market_snapshots
# RAISE(ABORT) on any UPDATE/DELETE. insert_snapshot() is called roughly once
# per second across many live call sites (market_scanner discovery sweeps,
# monitor_refresh, event reactor, exit_lifecycle, ...), each a single-row
# INSERT -- doing the sanctioned trigger drop/verify/re-create dance
# (precedent: scripts/repair_executable_snapshot_corruption.py) on EVERY
# insert would multiply the trigger-absent exposure window by the table's
# full insert frequency for no benefit, since a single firing's LIMIT already
# clears far more backlog than accumulates between firings. Cadence-gated
# instead: fires roughly once every _INLINE_EXPIRE_THROTTLE inserts, via
# last_insert_rowid() modulo -- a deterministic SQL-native throttle with no
# in-process state (safe across threads/processes, unlike a Python counter).
#
# Uses SAVEPOINT, not BEGIN/BEGIN IMMEDIATE: insert_snapshot's caller already
# holds an open transaction by the time this runs (sqlite3's default
# isolation_level="" opens an implicit DEFERRED transaction on the INSERT
# above), and SQLite does not support a nested BEGIN. SAVEPOINT nests
# correctly regardless of whether an outer transaction is already active,
# giving the same all-or-nothing guarantee for the drop/delete/recreate
# sequence without disturbing the caller's transaction boundary.
#
# scripts/migrations/202608_executable_market_snapshots_retention.py remains
# available as the one-time backlog-drain tool for rows written before this
# inline mechanism existed; its companion launchd plist is optional in
