"""Runtime DB write coordination primitives.

This module is the first slice of the runtime DB lock refactor. It deliberately
does not migrate production writers yet. The contract it establishes is:

* one writer gate per DB file, shared by LIVE and BULK writes;
* multi-DB leases acquire gates in canonical path order;
* only single-DB transactions are opened here, so this layer does not pretend
  independent SQLite connections are cross-file atomic.
