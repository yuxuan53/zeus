"""Strategy attribution surface — K1-compliant read-only projection.

Historical note: this module used to maintain a persistent JSON file
(`strategy_tracker-{mode}.json`) populated by record_entry / record_exit /
record_settlement callbacks fired from the runtime. That design violated
K1 (derived surfaces must not have write authority): the tracker was a
second, out-of-band ledger that drifted from position_events across
bankroll resets, producing phantom PnL totals (e.g. opening_inertia
showed +$210.68 while position_events said -$13.03). It also fed the
`strategy_edge_compression_alerts` signal that in turn drove RiskGuard's
strategy_signal_level — so "not authority" was a lie in practice.

Post-K1 contract:

1. StrategyTracker has NO write path. record_* methods are retained as
   no-op shims for backward compatibility so existing callers in
   cycle_runtime.py, fill_tracker.py, harvester.py, and event hooks do not
   break. They log at debug level only.
2. summary() queries the canonical settlement rows via
   query_authoritative_settlement_rows (which reads from position_events
   through _normalize_position_settlement_event). Results are deduped by
   trade_id so a duplicate SETTLED event (pre-bug-#9-fix data) cannot
   double-count PnL.
3. edge_compression_check() returns an empty list. Edge compression is
   a real signal that should be recomputed from a canonical event-log
   time-series, not from the tracker's persisted trades. Re-enablement
   is deferred to a follow-up packet that wires it through the
   settlement_fact / decision_fact tables.
4. save_tracker() is a no-op. It does not touch the disk. If a legacy
   `strategy_tracker-*.json` file still exists on disk, the nuke runbook
   deletes it; the new code never regenerates one.
5. load_tracker() returns a fresh empty StrategyTracker — there is no
   state to load. The disk file (if present) is ignored.

Callers MUST call summary() to read values. They MUST NOT look at
tracker.strategies[*].trades directly — that list is permanently empty.
