"""Chain-mirror reconciliation core: classify + (optionally) repair position_current
against venue chain truth.

Authority basis: operator directive 2026-07-04 (root AGENTS.md §2 reconciliation
order Chain > Chronicler > Portfolio); design doc
docs/rebuild/chain_mirror_state_model_2026-07-04.md.

Public surface:
    ChainPositionFact         — one venue data-api position row.
    LocalPositionRow          — one position_current row, read-only view.
    MirrorFinding             — one classification result (may or may not imply a write).
    grade_bin                 — pure win/lose/unknown grading helper.
    classify_local_position   — classify a single local row against chain truth (pure).
    classify_chain_only_asset — classify a chain token with no matching local row (pure).
    load_chain_positions_by_asset(raw_positions) -> dict[str, ChainPositionFact]
    load_local_position_rows(conn) -> list[LocalPositionRow]
    load_settlement_lookup(forecasts_conn) -> dict[tuple, SettlementFact]
    is_zeus_origin_asset(conn, asset_id) -> bool
    has_open_orders_for_position(conn, position_id) -> bool
    apply_size_correction_finding(conn, finding, *, now) — in-transaction
        CHAIN_SIZE_CORRECTED primitive.
    apply_size_correction_finding_coordinated(finding, *, now) — bounded public
        fallback used by src.state.chain_reconciliation.
    reconcile(conn_trades, conn_forecasts, chain_by_asset, *, apply, now) -> ReconcileReport
    run_cycle() — scheduler entrypoint (fetches chain positions + DB conns,
        classifies read-only, then applies one bounded position quantum at a
        time). R4-b: moved from
        src.main::_chain_mirror_reconcile_cycle (main.py registers it on a
        10-minute APScheduler cadence).

No network I/O and no venue mutation happens in this module. The CLI wrapper
(scripts/reconcile_chain_mirror.py) owns adapter construction; this module only
consumes already-fetched chain facts. Apply mode also refreshes append-first
positive-chain observations before their executable-inventory authority
expires; that write preserves phase, owned shares, and cost basis.

P0b (2026-07-04, docs/rebuild/chain_mirror_state_model_2026-07-04.md §5
follow-up): the REVIEW_OPEN_ABSENT class (open-phase row, held token absent,
market unresolved) escalates to CLOSED_EXITED only for a fill-unproven local
projection after the SAME absence appears on two consecutive mirror runs with
zero open orders. A confirmed fill remains open for review until exit,
redemption, transfer, or settlement evidence explains the disappearance;
Data API omission alone cannot erase real economic exposure.
The "has this been seen before" signal is a lightweight, append-only
REVIEW_REQUIRED marker event (phase_after == phase_before, no lifecycle
mutation) — see _has_prior_review_open_absent_marker.

    set from the venue data-api (read-only GET /positions — no order
    construction, no signing, no redeem submission), diffs every
    position_current row and every chain token per
    docs/rebuild/chain_mirror_state_model_2026-07-04.md, and auto-applies the
    two safe repair classes: (a) settlement closes when a graded position's
    held token is absent from chain and its market has a VERIFIED
    settlement_outcomes row, (b) chain_shares corrections when a held token's
    chain size differs from the local record, and (c) phase-preserving
    positive-chain observation refreshes before SELL authority expires. Every other class
    (foreign tokens, missing local rows, open-but-absent ambiguity) is logged
    as a finding only — never written.

    This is the "no row stays quarantined past one reconcile cycle" backstop:
    it reclassifies every local row via chain truth on every tick regardless
    of its current phase, so a quarantined row with a gradable chain outcome
    drains into settled within one cycle without requiring every quarantine
