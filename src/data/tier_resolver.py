"""Deterministic tier resolution for observation_instants_v2 source routing.

Maps every Zeus city to exactly one of three tiers based on its
``settlement_source_type`` field in ``config/cities.json``. Tier choice
determines which hourly-observation client is called during backfill and
which ``source`` string is allowed by the typed v2 writer (antibody A2).

Structural principle P1 (plan v3 L9): *settlement source IS observation
source*. There is deliberately no OpenMeteo Tier-4 escape hatch — a city
must either have a native hourly source or accept a gap (Hong Kong).

Public API
----------
- ``class Tier`` — the three Phase 0 tiers.
- ``tier_for_city(city_name, target_date=None) -> Tier`` — resolves a city
  to its tier. The ``target_date`` parameter is accepted for forward
  compatibility with per-city date-range schedules; it is ignored today.
- ``cities_in_tier(tier) -> frozenset[str]`` — inverse mapping for audit.
- ``TIER_SCHEDULE`` — the full ``dict[city_name, Tier]`` (public constant
  for antibody A3 and ``scripts/audit_observation_instants_v2.py``).
- ``TIER_ALLOWED_SOURCES`` — per-tier whitelist of acceptable ``source``
  column values (antibody A2 whitelist for the v2 writer).
- ``source_role_assessment_for_city_source`` — P1.1 training-eligibility
  registry helper that distinguishes primary sources from documented fallback
  evidence without changing writer allowlists.

Invariants (checked by ``tests/test_tier_resolver.py``, antibody A3)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- I1. Every city in ``src.config.cities_by_name`` has exactly one tier.
- I2. ``cities_in_tier(Tier.WU_ICAO)`` equals
  ``{c.name for c in cities if settlement_source_type == 'wu_icao'}``.
- I3. ``cities_in_tier(Tier.OGIMET_METAR)`` equals
  ``{c.name for c in cities if settlement_source_type == 'noaa'}``.
- I4. ``cities_in_tier(Tier.HKO_NATIVE)`` equals ``{'Hong Kong'}``.
- I5. ``settlement_source_type == 'cwa_station'`` raises
  ``UnsupportedTierError`` — no city uses this today (Taipei migrated
  2026-04-15). A future re-introduction needs an explicit tier decision.
