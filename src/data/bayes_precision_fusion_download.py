"""F1 step-2/3/9 — the FORWARD + walk-forward BAYES_PRECISION_FUSION multi-model download/persist job.

For each current-target (city, metric, target_date, lead) x the extra Open-Meteo models
(decorrelated globals icon_global/ukmo_global + icon_eu + the domain-gated CONUS/N-America nests
ncep_nbm/gfs_hrrr/gem_hrdps + in-domain regionals icon_d2/arome/ukmo_uk), this job:
(2026-06-17: the coarse globals gfs_global 25km / gem_global 15km, the settlement-cold
jma_seamless, AND the alias-dedup probe icon_seamless were all DROPPED from the fusion; they are
no longer fetched here.)

  (1) FORWARD single_runs fetch  — today's current-target value at the fixed cycle (live input
      for the replacement posterior and replay; SPEC §3 single-runs identity). REUSES
      bayes_precision_fusion_capture._default_live_fetch.
  (2) fixed-lead previous_runs fetch — the no-leak walk-forward train value via the OM
      previous-runs API temperature_2m_previous_dayN hourly var (SPEC §3 fixed-lead). Forces
      temperature_unit=celsius (forecast_value_c is ALWAYS degC -> SPEC §7 C/F unit-mix antibody).
  (3) INSERTs the surviving rows into raw_model_forecasts (raw live input, training_allowed=0),
      on a SINGLE zeus-forecasts.db connection (INV-37), UNIQUE-idempotent per cycle.
  (4) PRUNES rows older than the retention cutoff (~180d, SPEC §5) in the same transaction.

FAIL-SOFT IS STRUCTURAL: a per-model fetch failure (raise OR None) DROPS that model's row and
the job proceeds with the survivors — a dropped model is simply absent (the fusion handles
missing sources by construction). The job writes raw_model_forecasts only; the live materializer
later consumes those rows as replacement-posterior inputs and writes forecast_posteriors. A
missing current capture is therefore a live probability-input gap, not a harmless replay gap.
