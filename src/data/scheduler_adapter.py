"""Scheduler adapter — PR6 (pure planner; daemon wiring is operator-gated).

Turns the job registry (src/data/source_job_registry) into per-job APScheduler build specs,
assigning each job an EXECUTOR CLASS by intent so the single-writer SQLite lock no longer lets
DB-heavy jobs starve heartbeats:

    source_clock_db     — latency-critical source publication -> short live write
    hko_source_clock_db — HKO conditional HTTP + short live write, isolated from METAR
    hko_final_source_clock_db — finalized HKO Daily Extract, isolated from realtime polling
    forecast_clock_db   — replacement forecast publication clock + scoped capture
    station_forecast_clock_db — official station forecast publication clocks
    oracle_guard_db     — Day0 source disagreement guard
    observation_db      — supplemental observation ingest
    forecast_source_db  — current forecast downloads/materialization
    forecast_archive_db — previous-runs history maintenance
    market_topology_db  — Gamma/CLOB market discovery
    settlement_db       — settlement truth collection
    venue_event_db      — long-running venue event ingestion
    backfill_db         — other backfill / historical DB writers (incl. UMA)
    derived_db          — derived DB writers (calibration, skill, drift)
    io                  — non-DB IO jobs
    health_io           — health/status/evidence probes (file-only, potentially slow)
    heartbeat           — process liveness heartbeat only

This module is the structural home of the "UMA must not write the DB on the file-only fast
executor" fix: by construction a writes_db job is assigned a *_db class, never io/heartbeat.

R3 (2026-07-08, ingest contractualization): the legacy hand-coded add_job() scheduler mode and
its ZEUS_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE/ZEUS_USE_LEGACY_DATA_COLLECTION/ZEUS_SCHEDULER_REGISTRY_ENABLED
mode-flag machinery were DELETED — zero-caller-verified (no deploy/launchd plist ever set any of
those env vars; the registry-built path has been the sole live path since PR #329). The
registry-built scheduler is now unconditional, not merely the default.
