#   + operator green-light 2026-06-10 (free METAR fast lane; no paid sources);
#   NOAA/NWS station files provide current-exposure priority transport, cycle
#   files provide the global delta, and aviationweather.gov provides recovery.
"""Day0 fast observation lane: free METAR feed for the running-extreme tracker.

First principles
----------------
The day0 absorbing boundary is driven by the settlement station's running
extreme. WU (the Polymarket settlement reference) publishes the same ASOS/METAR
stream after the observation. NOAA/NWS station files expose exact held-family
updates, cycle files expose global METAR deltas, and aviationweather.gov
supplies bounded history and recovery. This module emits
``DAY0_EXTREME_UPDATED`` when the running extreme moves or a strictly newer
station observation advances the remaining-window clock.

Provenance law (source + authority on every datum):
- source_id "aviationweather_metar"; station identity validated against the
  city's configured settlement station (city.wu_station). The METAR station IS
  the physical settlement sensor; only the distribution channel differs from WU.
- observation_available_at = the feed's receiptTime (the honest publication
  clock), NOT our fetch wall-clock. Events therefore carry true latency.
- WU stays settlement truth: this lane NEVER writes settlement values; it only
  advances the day0 running-extreme boundary, and the parallel WU lane is used
  by src/data/day0_oracle_anomaly.py to cross-check for oracle anomalies
  (Paris CDG sensor-tampering class, April 2026).

Unit law (F-settled cities)
---------------------------
METAR temperatures are Celsius. US ASOS METARs carry the T-group (tenths of a
degree C) — converting tenths-C to F is exact to <0.1F. A report WITHOUT a
T-group is whole-degree C; converting it to F can be off by ~1F at bin
boundaries, which could falsely KILL an alive bin. Fail-closed rule: at
F-settled cities, reports without a T-group are SKIPPED for extreme tracking
(understating the running extreme is monotone-safe; overstating is not).
C-settled cities consume whole-C reports exactly.

# --- METAR PLAUSIBILITY BOUND (adversarial review 2026-06-10 fix 4) ---------
# One corrupt/spoofed METAR value must not permanently ratchet the monotone
# running extreme (emission is irreversible by design). SPIKE RULE: a value
# whose step from the previous accepted report exceeds the physical rate
# bound is accepted ONLY when the NEXT report corroborates it (stays within
# the bound of the suspect value). The LATEST report (no next yet) with an
# implausible step is held PENDING corroboration — the next fetch cycle
# re-evaluates it with its successor present. Genuine frontal jumps
# corroborate within one report interval (~30-60 min) — bounded delay, never
# a permanent loss.
# Held prints are excluded from extremes (no bin-kill), counted on the
# extremes object, WARN-logged, and reported to the oracle-anomaly module.

# BEFORE this one — an absolute band from the city's monthly climatology
# (config/city_monthly_bounds.json p01/p99) that held any value outright
# regardless of corroboration. Deleted: METAR is an official published
# aviation feed, the same class of source the settlement chain already
# trusts, and a climatology censor on it fires hardest on exactly the
# extreme-weather days that are the highest-value trades (2026-07-14 Paris:
# 11 consecutive, mutually consistent 32-35C reports held outright because a
# forecast-ensemble-derived band capped at 31.9C — the readings were real,
# not noise, and the gate had no way to tell the difference). The spike rule
# below is not climatology-based — it is a fixed physical rate-of-change
# bound, independent of city or month — and stays; it is what actually

    unit='C' UNCONDITIONALLY — including reports without a T-group, which
    ``settlement_temp_for_report`` skips for F-settled cities (imprecise
    whole-C->F conversion could falsely cross a bin edge). The ledger's job
    is to record what was published, not to pre-apply a city-specific
    trust decision at write time — a print stored here is exactly what
    hydrate_from_ledger later reconstructs a MetarReport from, so storing
    the SAME raw Celsius a live fetch would have produced avoids a lossy
    C->F->C round trip. The F-city T-group unit law is instead applied at
    READ time (_latest_authorized_day0_fact's ledger fact, using the stored
    raw_report text) — one rule, one place to keep in sync.

class Day0FastObsEmitter:
    """Stateful fast-lane emitter: prefetch (HTTP) -> emit (DB writes).

    Emission policy is MONOTONE: a (city, date, metric) emits only when the
    rounded running extreme moves in the absorbing direction (high: up,
    low: down) or on first sight. Re-emissions of the same report dedup at the
    event store via the idempotency key (available_at = feed receiptTime).
    In-process memo only — a daemon restart re-emits once and dedups.

    SOURCE-FAILURE DISCIPLINE (PR#404 operator review P0-3):
      - every fetch ATTEMPT (success or failure) arms the throttle — an API
        outage can never produce a tight retry storm;
      - a failed fetch serves the old cache with an explicit
        ``stale_cache_after_failure`` status (never silently as fresh);
      - stale-after-failure data older than the city's measured staleness
        budget is NEVER emitted as a live-authority event — it may only
        advance the monotone hard-fact kill memo (kill direction is
        staleness-safe; entries are not).

        A cold process's ``_cached_reports`` is empty until the first
        successful transport poll, and that wait is unbounded during an
        outage. Every consumer of the cache
        (latest_extremes' entry gate, emit_prefetched's own extreme
        computation) silently has NOTHING for that whole window. This is a
        BRIDGE, not a replacement for the kill-memo restart recovery
        (_recover_kill_memo_from_events, defense in depth, unchanged) —
        only the in-process cache path.

        No-op once the cache is NON-EMPTY (a successful fetch or a prior
        hydration) — that is the only state hydration must never overwrite.
        A FAILED fetch attempt (``_last_attempt_monotonic`` armed, cache
        still empty) must NOT block hydration: in the live reactor the
        prefetch always runs before emit, so its failed attempt has already
        armed that flag by the time this runs — gating on it would make
        hydration dead code in exactly the outage scenario it exists for.
        Sets
        ``_cache_fetched_monotonic`` to now: hydration IS this process's
        best current view of the world, exactly like a fresh fetch would be
        — and the normal 90s throttle means a genuine live fetch supersedes
        it almost immediately regardless.

        Fail-soft: any error is logged and swallowed; the cache simply stays

    Reads opportunity_events (zeus-world.db) for the cell, keeps only memo-safe
    rows (source_authorized_status=AUTHORIZED, local_date_status=MATCH,
    dst_status=UNAMBIGUOUS — the SAME authorization the live kill memo required),
    ACROSS EVERY AUTHORIZED SOURCE for the cell (not just this emitter's own
    fast-lane source), and reduces by the absorbing direction (high=MAX,
    low=MIN). None when no recoverable row exists or on any error (fail-soft).

    2026-07-16 (day0 defect-3, operator directive): this query used to also
    filter ``settlement_source = FAST_OBS_SOURCE_ID``, so a cold in-process
    memo could only ever recover this emitter's OWN prior emissions — never
    a higher/lower extreme another source (e.g. wu_icao_history) had already
    established for the same cell. That self-blinding contradicted this very
    docstring's "restart-safe... recover the kill-memo" claim and let a
    newly-eligible fast-lane fetch treat its own first-sight value as the
    day-so-far extreme even when a truer one already existed. Deleted the
    source filter; the existing AUTHORIZED/MATCH/UNAMBIGUOUS predicates are
    already source-agnostic and are the actual authorization gate.

    ``world_conn`` MUST be supplied by the caller (a world-main read connection or
    a composite connection with zeus-world ATTACHed). Passing None raises
    RuntimeError immediately — the old "open a fresh connection when None" fallback
    has been DELETED because it caused the day0 connection-burst regression
    (commit 347f713d): 47 simultaneous per-city independent world connections opened
    inside the reactor cycle that already held the composite write lock, producing
    SQLITE_BUSY × 47 per cycle. See docs/evidence/lock_storm/
    2026-06-13_lock_storm_regression_archaeology.md for the full mechanism.
