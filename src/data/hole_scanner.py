"""K2 hole scanner: continuous data-coverage reconciliation.

Core of Zeus's live data-ingestion immune system. Periodically (and on
daemon boot) the scanner:

1. Computes the *expected* row set for each of the 4 upstream data tables
   (observations, observation_instants, solar_daily, forecasts). Expected
   rows are a cross product of configured cities, applicable data sources,
   and the target_date range [global_floor, today - publication_lag].

2. Queries the `data_coverage` ledger for *covered* rows (status=WRITTEN or
   LEGITIMATE_GAP).

3. Computes the diff — expected minus covered — these are the holes.

4. Applies the static whitelist from `config/data_availability_exceptions.yaml`
   to pin holes that legitimately cannot be filled:
     - target_date before model retro start → LEGITIMATE_GAP
     - target_date before city onboarded_at → LEGITIMATE_GAP
     - target_date inside publication-lag window → not a hole (skip)

5. Writes the remaining holes as MISSING rows in `data_coverage` so that
   downstream fillers (`src/data/*_append.py`) can act on them via
   `find_pending_fills`.

Design note: scanner is read-only with respect to the data tables themselves.
It never INSERTs into observations / observation_instants / solar_daily /
forecasts. Its only write target is `data_coverage`. Fill is a separate
operation that calls the live-append modules, keeping the detection and
remediation phases cleanly separated.

Not scope of this module:
- Actually fetching the holes — that's `_append.py` modules + a fill driver
- Online verifiers (HKO API cross-check) — stubbed here; implemented by
  `src/data/hole_scanner_verifiers.py` in a later step
- APScheduler integration — `src/main.py` owns job registration
