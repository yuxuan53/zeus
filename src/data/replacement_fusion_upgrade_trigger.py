# Authority basis: Task #32 (operator 2026-06-11) — PARTIAL fusions never upgrade when late
#   instruments publish. The materializer reads CURRENT values from the persisted single_runs
#   capture (gem via previous_runs exception) at the OM9 anchor cycle; a provider whose
#   single_runs row was not yet persisted at materialize time is dropped, and the resulting
#   served<5 posterior is then marked "covered" (q_lcb NOT NULL) by all three coverage gates —
#   which key coverage on the baseline_b0 (ecmwf_open_data) run, BLIND to the bayes_precision_fusion decorrelated
#   instrument set. So the scope never re-materializes even after its 5th provider lands.
#   K-decision: compare both the served provider-family set and the exact persisted CURRENT input
#   revisions consumed by the latest posterior. A new family, changed provider row, or changed
#   Day0 hourly-vector bundle requires re-materialization.
"""SINGLE-AUTHORITY comparison + idempotent enqueue for the PARTIAL-fusion upgrade trigger.

The decorrelated-provider FAMILY mapping (`decorrelated_provider_families_of`) is the SOLE
authority for "which model belongs to which of the 5 decorrelated provider families". The
materializer's served/missing-provider determination imports it (single-builder), so the
trigger and the fusion can never disagree on what "served 5/5" means.

The comparison (`scope_capture_offers_larger_provider_set`) is the SOLE authority for whether
the latest posterior's provider set or exact CURRENT input revisions have been superseded. The
seed-discovery / queue / plan coverage gates remain keyed on baseline_b0 + q_lcb (their job is
freshness/tradeable-grade, not input revision detection).

The enqueue (`enqueue_fusion_upgrade_reseeds`) durably reserves the UNIQUE transition marker,
writes via the EXISTING atomic write_seed into owner-private hidden staging, then durably
finalizes ownership before an atomic hardlink publish into the SAME seed_dir the materialize
cycle already drains — no new daemon or parallel materialization path. The marker is UNIQUE on
(city, target_date, metric, source_cycle_time, capturable_family_set): family growth uses the
canonical family set as its transition key; exact input revisions suffix that key with the
changed source raw-row ids. A transition has at most one active publication. If that publication
is consumed without converging the posterior and has no terminal no-retry receipt, the same marker
is atomically reclaimed so a failed consumer cannot turn idempotency into permanent starvation.

# THE single authority mapping model -> decorrelated provider family. Mirrors exactly the
# materializer's per-provider check (replacement_forecast_materializer lines ~1012-1024): the
# physical providers each contribute ONE representative to the fusion, and a family is "served"
# when ANY of its members is in the fused set. The ECMWF anchor is intentionally NOT here: it is
# the PRIOR (not a decorrelated likelihood provider). icon_seamless was also NOT here and has since
# been removed from the candidate set entirely (2026-06-17 — it was the alias-dedup probe, not a
# provider). The materializer imports DECORRELATED_PROVIDER_FAMILIES so the two sites can never
# drift on what counts as a provider.
# 2026-06-17 COARSE-GLOBAL REMOVAL: the 0.25°/25km gfs_global and ~15km gem_global are dropped
# from the fusion (model_selection.DECORR_GLOBALS), so they are no longer family members here.
# NCEP is now repped ONLY by its CONUS nests (gfs_hrrr 3km / ncep_nbm ~13km) and CMC ONLY by the
# HRDPS 2.5km North-America nest — both DOMAIN-GATED. OUTSIDE those nest domains NCEP/CMC have no
# servable member and are STRUCTURALLY ABSENT for that city; the flat 5-family count would then
# false-flag them as "missing". `expected_provider_families_for_city` below is the per-city
# domain-aware expected set that replaces the flat count at the materializer's completeness gate.
# 2026-06-17 JMA DROP (operator, settlement-graded): jma_seamless (the only JMA member) is the
# coldest/least-precise global (lead-1 raw bias -1.46, MAE 2.124) and was dropped from the fusion
# (model_selection.DECORR_GLOBALS). The JMA family is therefore REMOVED entirely here — no member
# can ever serve, so it must never be expected anywhere. The contract is now {NCEP, DWD, CMC, UKMO}.

    A decorrelated provider family is EXPECTED for a city AT THIS LEAD only if it has a member
    that is SERVABLE there-and-then: a pure-global member (available worldwide at any lead) OR a
    domain-gated member whose polygon covers (lat, lon) AND whose max_lead_days cap is not
    exceeded at ``lead_days``. After the coarse-global drop, NCEP (gfs_hrrr / ncep_nbm, both
    CONUS) and CMC (gem_hrdps, N-America) are nest-only; outside those domains — OR at a lead
    PAST the nest's max_lead_days cap (gfs_hrrr=2, ncep_nbm=3, gem_hrdps=2) — they are NOT
    expected, so a non-CONUS/non-NA city, AND a CONUS/NA city at far lead, is COMPLETE on the
    pure globals {DWD, UKMO} (+ anchor) with no phantom PARTIAL flag and no upgrade re-enqueue.

    LEAD-AWARENESS IS LOAD-BEARING (2026-06-17 critic fix): lead 0 is NOT "the most permissive
    lead" — it is the OPPOSITE. A nest eligible at lead 0 becomes INELIGIBLE past its cap, so a
    lead-0 expected set over-expects NCEP/CMC at far lead (CONUS lead>=4 / NA lead>=3) and
    re-fires the exact phantom-PARTIAL + upgrade loop this contract exists to kill. The expected
    set MUST be evaluated at the lead the fusion actually serves (the city-local lead).

    The "is this member domain-gated" test is `_REGIONAL_DOMAIN_KEY` membership — the SAME gate
    `regional_eligible` itself keys on. A member NOT in `_REGIONAL_DOMAIN_KEY` is a pure global
    (icon_global / ukmo_global) servable at any lead; this correctly treats the domain-gated
    global `ncep_nbm_conus` (CONUS-only, NOT in REGIONAL_MODELS) as gated, which a
    `REGIONAL_MODELS`-only test would miss. Fail-soft: any error -> all families expected (the
