# Authority basis: immutable decision-q certificate authority for settlement skill
#   attribution (lifecycle-alpha) — the grader resolves q_live/q_lcb_5pct from the
#   immutable ActionableTradeCertificate (decision_certificates, LIVE/VERIFIED)
#   reached via the exact ENTRY position_decision_attribution row, once identity
#   (condition_id/direction/token_id) and payload_hash verify. A position whose
#   decision-q certificate is unresolvable (absent/unverified/identity mismatch/
#   hash mismatch/no q_live) grades UNATTRIBUTABLE_Q_MISSING and is never
#   SKILL/LUCK. Global-auction certificates additionally attempt to close
#   through their schema21 receipt (trades.decision_log); receipt closure is an
#   AUDIT-INTEGRITY signal recorded as ``receipt_closure`` on the resolved q, not
#   a q-availability gate — a partial declaration or a receipt whose
#   decision_log row was removed by the 30-day retention migration
#   (scripts/migrations/202608_decision_log_retention.py) no longer erases an
#   otherwise-VERIFIED certificate's q (2026-09-03 fix; previously 379/1114
#   settled positions since 06-09 were wrongly UNATTRIBUTABLE_Q_MISSING purely
#   on receipt-closure grounds, halving the market-anchored admission
#   calibrator's training set).
# Prior authority basis:
#   - Operator skill-vs-luck law 2026-06-12 (verbatim): "wu预测92不是结算在92就算赢了
#     说明这是一单完全运气获胜跟我们的系统无关 甚至会假装我们的系统正常因为'盈利了'
#     昨天3单全部刚好踩在结算哪一个温度上就已经说明问题". A LUCKY win masquerades as
#     system health and poisons the learning loop; the >51% settlement win-rate goal
#     must count SKILL, not luck.
#   - Settlement-grading SPINE (one-builder law): reuses
#     src.contracts.graded_receipt.grade_receipt (Direction Law + unit antibody +
#     BinKind membership). NO parallel grader.
#   - Join pattern + bin construction reused from

"""settlement_skill_attribution — grade every settled position into a skill category.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A profitable settlement is NOT evidence the system works. The operator's 06-12
losses landed EXACTLY on the settled bin 3/3 (the market priced those bins 2-2.5x
our q and won) — systematic miscalibration. Conversely a win where our own
freshest data DISAGREED with the position (Denver: our fresh NBM hourly said 90.0,
so our NO on 90-91 should lose, but the stale 0.79 posterior held and it happened
to win) is a LUCKY win that tells us nothing about skill. Counting either as a
plain win/loss poisons the learning loop and lets a lucky win fake system health.

This organ grades each SETTLED position into a typed category by comparing THREE
quantities:
  (1) our position direction + traded bin,
  (2) our DECISION-TIME q (q_live on the fill) AND the FRESHEST data available at
      settlement-eve (the latest forecast_posteriors cycle for the family),
  (3) the settled outcome (grade_receipt) + the market's final price (the fill
      price IS the market-implied probability).

THE SIX CATEGORIES
------------------
  SKILL_WIN          won AND our fresh-data q supported the position.
  LUCKY_WIN          won BUT our own freshest data disagreed (Denver-if-92) —
                     a MISS in skill accounting.
  SKILL_LOSS         lost but the position was right under fresh data (honest
                     variance).
  MISCALIBRATED_LOSS lost AND the market priced the settled bin a large factor
                     above our q AND the market was right (the 3-loss shape).
  STALE_DECISION     the decision-time posterior was older than the family
                     freshness budget / a strictly-fresher cycle existed
                     unconsumed AT DECISION TIME (born-stale gets its own brand
                     regardless of outcome). "Unconsumed" is measured against the
                     posterior the decision ACTUALLY consumed (the certificate's
                     posterior_id), never against settlement-eve data — see
                     _fresher_cycle_existed_at_decision.
  UNATTRIBUTABLE_Q_MISSING
                     the immutable decision-q certificate is unresolvable — absent,
                     not VERIFIED, identity mismatch, payload_hash mismatch, or no
                     q_live in the payload — so the system's ACTUAL decision-time
                     q is unknown. Without it the outcome cannot be attributed to
                     skill or luck — the position is NEVER graded SKILL_WIN/
                     LUCKY_WIN and is excluded from the skill denominator (never
                     silently time-reconstructed as the skill authority). A
                     global-auction certificate whose receipt closure is
                     incomplete (partial declaration / missing decision_log row /
                     artifact mismatch) is NOT unattributable on that basis alone
                     — q_live from an identity- and hash-verified certificate is
                     still authoritative; the closure defect is recorded as
                     ``receipt_closure`` for audit, not folded into this gate.

THE DECISION-Q AUTHORITY (provenance, 2026-06-21)
-------------------------------------------------
The skill authority is the IMMUTABLE decision-time q the system committed at
entry, carried in the exact ENTRY position_decision_attribution link to an
ActionableTradeCertificate (decision_certificates, LIVE/VERIFIED). q_live +
q_lcb_5pct live directly in that cert's payload_json and are extracted once
identity (condition_id/direction/token_id) and payload_hash verify — this is
the ONLY q-availability gate. A certificate that declares global-auction
provenance additionally ATTEMPTS to close through the exact schema21 global
receipt (trades.decision_log); the outcome of that attempt is recorded
alongside the q as ``receipt_closure`` (one of "not_global" — no global
declaration, nothing to close; "closed" — receipt verified end-to-end;
"partial_declaration" — one of the top-level/nested receipt references is
present without the other; "trades_not_attached"; "decision_log_row_missing"
— the referenced row was removed by retention (routine, expected under the
30-day retention migration); "artifact_mismatch" — a declared receipt's
content disagrees with the decision_log artifact (a real red flag, distinct
from a routine retention prune))
but a non-"closed" status is an AUDIT finding, never a reason to discard an
otherwise-VERIFIED certificate's q_live. An ordinary exact ENTRY certificate
(no global declaration) has no trades attachment or decision-log requirement
at all. The time-reconstructed posterior (the latest forecast_posteriors cycle
at/<= decision_time) is a DEBUG aid ONLY — it is NOT the skill authority and
never grades a position SKILL/LUCK on its own.

The skill win-rate that matters:
    SKILL_WIN / (SKILL_WIN + LUCKY_WIN + SKILL_LOSS + MISCALIBRATED_LOSS)
STALE_DECISION rows are excluded from the denominator (the decision was born
stale — its outcome carries no skill signal either way). UNATTRIBUTABLE_Q_MISSING
rows are likewise excluded (no immutable decision-q means no attributable skill
signal).

READING A HISTORICAL ROW'S fresher_cycle_existed_at_decision (2026-07-27)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The flag means what this module says ONLY on rows graded at/after
``STALE_PREDICATE_FIX_LANDED_AT``. Earlier rows were produced by the discredited
predicate (settlement-eve vs time-reconstructed decision posterior) and their 1s
are systematically false — verified read-only on live: 266/266 joinable flagged
rows had that "fresher" posterior computed AFTER the position's own
POSITION_OPEN_INTENT, median +26.8h. Predicate identity is NOT in
``schema_version`` (which is 1 on every row and tracks table shape, never
algorithm), so ``graded_at`` is the discriminator — use
``fresher_flag_is_trustworthy``, never the literal 1 alone:

    SELECT * FROM settlement_attribution
     WHERE fresher_cycle_existed_at_decision = 1
       AND graded_at >= '<STALE_PREDICATE_FIX_LANDED_AT>';

The affected rows are NOT re-graded and NOT corrected. 203 of them carry a
persisted ``q_live`` that is the LAST COPY of that decision's belief — a
2026-07-24 migration deleted 1,290,540 certificates, so a re-grade would resolve
only 38 and destroy the other 165 into UNATTRIBUTABLE_Q_MISSING. Destroying
irreplaceable evidence to repair a flag is the larger data crime; the flag is
made legible instead, and whether to re-grade is an operator decision.
``count_discredited_stale_brands`` counts the STALE brands with no surviving
basis (the age-vs-budget test is unaffected by the defect, so a row that also
fails it stays stale on grounds that hold).

THRESHOLD DERIVATION (no bare magic numbers)
--------------------------------------------
  "market disagreed by a large factor" = market_in_bin_prob / our_q_in_bin >=
  LARGE_FACTOR. LARGE_FACTOR = 2.0 is the LOWER edge of the operator's directly
  observed 2.0-2.5x band on the 06-12 losses (derivation_note records this on
  every row). It is a data-anchored boundary, not an invented constant: the band
  came from the three real settled losses, and the lower edge is the conservative
  (fewer false MISCALIBRATED) choice.

  "fresh data supports the position" = the freshest posterior's q for the held
  token > 0.5 (a buy_no position is supported when fresh P(settle OUT of bin) >
  0.5; a buy_yes when fresh P(settle IN bin) > 0.5). 0.5 is the direction-neutral
  decision boundary, not a tunable.

HONESTY DISCIPLINE
------------------
- Read-only over graded/forecast tables; the ONLY write is the
  settlement_attribution row (sole writer).
- Idempotent per position (UNIQUE(position_id) + skip-if-present).
- A position with no VERIFIED settlement is NOT graded (never fabricated).
- A position whose fresh-data lane is absent is graded on the data we DO have,
  with fresh_q_supports_position recorded NULL — never guessed.

    defect (see _resolve_decision_q_from_certificate) is NOT one of these
    failure modes — that certificate still resolves a q and only contributes
    its closure status to the aggregated ``receipt_closure`` below.

    A single-tranche position (the common case, and every position before this

    cert, weighting is moot, consumed_posterior_id is that cert's own. A
    multi-tranche position's consumed_posterior_id is left None (never guessed

    Both halves of the comparison must be decision-time quantities or the answer is

    a time-reconstructed decision posterior, which reduces to "did anyone publish a
    posterior after we traded" — true of every trade in a family that kept
    forecasting (live: 266/266 flagged rows had the 'fresher' posterior computed
    AFTER entry, median 26.8h later; 211/243 STALE rows were inside their freshness
    budget). This asks the question the brand claims to answer instead: strictly
    newer than the CONSUMED posterior AND already computed at/<= the decision.

    Fail-closed shape (INV-47) — this is a grading predicate, not a runtime gate, so
    its "gate" is the STALE_DECISION brand on ONE position:
      SCOPE  one position_id. Unresolvable inputs never widen to a family, city, or
             the whole corpus; each position resolves independently.

             uses only decision-time facts. An unknown consumed identity therefore
             costs the position its unconsumed-cycle check, never its skill signal.
      RESET  a re-grade recomputes it from scratch; the certificate corpus growing
             a previously-absent row flips a None to a real True/False on the next
             run. There is no latched state and no ratchet.
