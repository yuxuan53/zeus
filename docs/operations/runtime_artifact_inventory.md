# Runtime Artifact Inventory

Date: 2026-04-16
Branch: data-improve
Task: Docs lifecycle cleanup and runtime artifact inventory.
Changed files: `architecture/artifact_lifecycle.yaml`, `architecture/history_lore.yaml`, `architecture/topology.yaml`, `architecture/topology_schema.yaml`, `docs/operations/AGENTS.md`, `docs/operations/current_state.md`, `docs/operations/runtime_artifact_inventory.md`, `docs/operations/phase1live_2026-04-11_plan.md`, `docs/operations/task_2026-04-16_k6_k7_k8_math_semantics/work_log.md`, `scripts/topology_doctor.py`, `scripts/topology_doctor_docs_checks.py`, `scripts/topology_doctor_registry_checks.py`, `tests/test_topology_doctor.py`
Summary: Removed stale/completed operations artifacts from the live control surface, indexed runtime-local `.omx/.omc` planning artifacts, and added docs-mode checks for unregistered operation task folders, runtime plan inventory coverage, and progress/handoff placement.
Verification: `python scripts/topology_doctor.py --docs --summary-only`; `python scripts/topology_doctor.py --artifact-lifecycle --summary-only`; `python scripts/topology_doctor.py --history-lore --summary-only`; `python scripts/topology_doctor.py --context-budget --summary-only`; `python scripts/topology_doctor.py --planning-lock --changed-files <changed files> --plan-evidence docs/operations/current_state.md --summary-only`; `python scripts/topology_doctor.py --work-record --changed-files <changed files> --work-record-path docs/operations/runtime_artifact_inventory.md --summary-only`; `python scripts/topology_doctor.py --map-maintenance --map-maintenance-mode closeout --changed-files <changed files> --summary-only`; `python -m pytest -q tests/test_topology_doctor.py -k 'docs_mode or runtime_plan or progress_handoff or operation_task or artifact_lifecycle or work_record or history_lore'`; `git diff --check`. Broad `--source`, `--tests`, `--scripts`, and `--strict` remain blocked by pre-existing Dual-Track refactor registry debt outside this cleanup package.
Next: Keep runtime-local planning artifacts indexed here or mirror them into a tracked packet before treating them as durable project evidence; resolve Dual-Track source/test/script registry debt in the owning refactor package.
Status: active routing inventory

This file is the repo-facing index for planning/progress artifacts that are
created in local runtime directories (`.omx/` and `.omc/`). It is not governing law.
It prevents useful packet knowledge from living only in ignored runtime state.

## Policy

- `.omx/state/**`, `.omx/logs/**`, `.omc/state/**`, and `.omc/sessions/**` are runtime-only.
- `.omx/artifacts/**` and `.omc/artifacts/ask/**` are prompt/review transcripts unless a packet explicitly cites them.
- `.omx/plans/*.md`, `.omc/plans/*.md`, and selected `.omx/context/*.md` can contain durable planning or closeout evidence. They need either a repo mirror, an archive pointer, or an explicit discard note here.
- Completed packet evidence archives are local/ignored under `docs/archives/**`; do not make them default-read authority.

## Current Runtime Plan Artifacts
