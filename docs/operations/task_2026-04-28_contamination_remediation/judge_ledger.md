# Judge Ledger — Contamination Remediation 2026-04-28

Created: 2026-04-28
Judge: team-lead@zeus-harness-debate-2026-04-27 (reusing same team)
HEAD anchor: `pre-quarantine-snapshot-2026-04-28` (forensic tag on origin)
Topic: ./TOPIC.md
Methodology: `docs/methodology/adversarial_debate_for_project_evaluation.md` (this is the 5th cycle in the methodology's lineage; first 4 were R1+R2+R3+Tier 2)

## Active state

- current_phase: 0 (boot — re-casting 4 longlast teammates with new role brief)
- current_round: pre-R1
- pending_acks: 4 (proponent / opponent / critic / executor)
- mode: SEQUENTIAL (proponent R1 → opponent R1 → close R1; same R2)

## Round status

| Round | Proponent | Opponent | Critic | Executor | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Boot (re-cast) | _boot_proponent (18KB) | _boot_opponent (14KB/129L) | _boot_critic (13KB/210L) | standby | COMPLETE 04:25-04:27Z |
| R1 opening | R1_opening (220L; STAGE-GATED SURGICAL ~33-50h) | R1_opening (~280L; STAGE-GATED REVERT ~65-105h) | n/a (gates verdict) | n/a | COMPLETE 04:35Z |
| R2 rebuttal | R2_rebuttal (29KB / 04:41Z; 5 concessions to opponent's 4-line cluster + 2 logical hits on opponent's revert plan + HOLD on per-hunk-audit ROI) | PENDING (not on disk) | n/a | n/a | IN_PROGRESS (proponent done) |
| Final verdict | — | — | gates | — | not_started |
| Post-verdict implementation | — | — | gates | — | not_started |

## Proponent R2 headline (for handoff)

Engaged opponent's 4-line cluster (Therac-25 + xz-utils + §5.Z2 + 53a21ad self-admit) at face value with 5 concessions:
1. Independent critic-gate on EVERY in-flight fix is non-negotiable
2. 50+ tests written by contaminated session need INDEPENDENT critic audit
3. xz-utils precedent supports REVERT + INDEPENDENT REBUILD; my Stage B should be REVERT-then-critic-gate not critic-gate-trust
4. Stage 0 forensic freeze should be FORMAL gate before any subsequent stage
5. Meta-irony lands hardest on me; need critic-gate strengthening

HOLDS:
- Stage 2 30-50h per-hunk audit (450 hunks × 5-10 min = 60-100h actual; itself unaudited for ROI; §5.Z2 violation pattern — opponent's plan didn't run gate on own audit step)
- Stage 1 file-level revert: tier_resolver.py was INTRODUCED in 7027247; verify_truth_surfaces in same span — there's no "last-known-clean state" because file ceases to exist on revert; opponent's "revert to before" boundary breaks for contamination-introduced files

Likely verdict synthesis when opponent R2 lands: stage-gated with surgical-revert at COMMIT level (575f435 + 7027247) for drift introducers + INDEPENDENT critic-gate on restoration + process gates A-E parallel + targeted-not-exhaustive audit. ~50-75h aggregate.

## Forensic anchor

Tag `pre-quarantine-snapshot-2026-04-28` pushed to origin. Recovery: `git checkout pre-quarantine-snapshot-2026-04-28`. Reset: `git reset --hard pre-quarantine-snapshot-2026-04-28`.

## Empirical baseline (from session forensics)

| Surface | Result |
|---|---|
| 53a21ad commit | 385 files / 45,929 insertions / 1,059 deletions (massive worktree merge) |
| 53a21ad drift-area files touched | tigge_client.py + test_tigge_ingest.py (others likely in 385) |
| Our session's 8 commits | 0/8 touched 6 drift areas |
| Phase 1 archive (26 cards) vs drift keywords | 0/26 (1 marginal hit on verify_truth_surfaces.py as command, not warning) |
| Live pytest baseline | 90/22/0 (preserved through entire session) |
| Other co-tenant commits | 208bd79 (small, 2 files; clean) + 7b3735a (settlement_semantics, parallel-correct with our SIDECAR-3) |

## Process notes

- Per methodology §5.Z3 4-outcome categories: this debate operates on ALREADY-CONTAMINATED state, not theoretical decision. Outcomes are: full-revert / surgical-hunk / status-quo / critic-driven-forensic-audit. Each maps to different operator effort + different blast radius.
- Lessons from this cycle MUST feed back into methodology + zeus-ai-handoff SKILL after verdict.
- This is the FIRST cycle where the methodology is being tested AGAINST a contamination event partly enabled by the methodology's own culture. Meta-irony is in scope.

## Round-2+ reserved

Not yet planned. Verdict from this cycle determines whether further rounds are needed.
