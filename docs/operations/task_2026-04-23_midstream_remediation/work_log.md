# Midstream Remediation — Work Log

## W0 — 2026-04-23 — packet open

- Packet opened: `docs/operations/task_2026-04-23_midstream_remediation/`.
- Authority source: `docs/to-do-list/zeus_midstream_fix_plan_2026-04-23.md`
  (36-slice v2 plan, signed by pro-vega + con-nyx).
- Executor: team-lead (this session).
- Long-lasting critic: `con-nyx`.
- Upstream co-tenant: parallel agent working data-readiness
  (`docs/operations/task_2026-04-23_data_readiness_remediation/`).
- Initial state verified by independent probe:
  - Production `position_current`: 31 columns, canonical (no drift).
  - `config/provenance_registry.yaml`: already exists (516 lines, real
    content) — T1.b scope shifts from "create" to "audit + skipif removal".
  - `src/strategy/selection_family.py:92` — `make_family_id()` is
    deprecated; zero non-deprecated call sites in `src/` or `scripts/`.
  - `src/engine/cycle_runtime.py:703` — `execute_discovery_phase(..., *, env: str, deps)` canonical.
  - `src/engine/cycle_runtime.py:209` — `materialize_position(..., *, state: str, env: str, ...)` canonical.
  - Zeus venv at `.venv/` — `yaml 6.0.3`, `pytest 9.0.2`.

Fixing requires either (a) populating v2 ensemble_snapshots with `boundary_ambiguous=0` row in test setup, or (b) additional monkeypatch on `_read_v2_snapshot_metadata`.

## T4.1a — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Narrower split of plan T4.1 (full entry-wiring). T4.1a lands the
persistence PRIMITIVE per T4.0 Option E; T4.1b (follow-up, larger)
will wire it into the evaluator → lifecycle_events → position_events
entry-event emission path.

### Implementation

- `src/contracts/decision_evidence.py`:
  - Add `DECISION_EVIDENCE_CONTRACT_VERSION = 1` module constant.
  - Add `UnknownContractVersionError(ValueError)` class.
  - Add `to_json(self) -> str` inside the class body (not module-level
    monkeypatch — my first-draft workaround was based on the false
    premise that frozen dataclasses block body methods; surrogate
    critic HIGH finding corrected). Emits canonical payload
    `{"contract_version": 1, "fields": {...}}` via
    `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)` for byte-stable idempotency.
  - Add `from_json(cls, payload) -> DecisionEvidence` classmethod.
    Strict `type(version) is int and version == 1` guard prevents
    `True == 1` collision. Malformed JSON → plain `ValueError`.
    Missing keys / non-object payload / unknown fields → `UnknownContractVersionError`.
    `__post_init__` `ValueError`s propagate unwrapped so callers
    can distinguish schema drift (UnknownContractVersionError) from
    invalid-data (bare ValueError).
- NEW `tests/test_decision_evidence_persistence.py` with 18 tests
  across 5 classes: shape (3), round-trip (2), version-drift (5 —
  including the critical `True == 1` collision guard), malformed
  (6), `__post_init__` propagation (2).

### Three critic findings addressed inline

Surrogate `code-reviewer@opus` verdict: REQUEST CHANGES. Findings:

- **HIGH — method-attachment pattern based on false premise**: first
  draft attached `to_json` / `from_json` at module level via
  `DecisionEvidence.to_json = _to_json` monkeypatch. Critic noted
  `frozen=True` blocks only instance mutation, not class body
  methods. Fixed: moved methods into class body, deleted false
  comment + `# type: ignore` shields.
- **MEDIUM — version-drift coverage gaps**: critic called out
  `True == 1` collision (no strict-type guard), missing null version
  test, missing `__post_init__` propagation test. Fixed: strict
  `type(version) is int` guard in `from_json`; added 4 tests
  (null version, boolean-True version, sample_size=0 propagates bare
  ValueError, confidence_level=1.5 propagates bare ValueError).
- **LOW — asdict future risk**: `asdict(self)` recursively flattens
  nested dataclasses. Safe today (all fields JSON-native primitives)
  but brittle if a future contract bump adds Enum / nested record.
  Documented the constraint in `to_json` docstring.

Non-blocking finding deferred: Literal runtime enforcement
(`evidence_type="banana"` constructs) is pre-existing and out of
T4.1a scope; flagged for future slice.

### Regression evidence

- `pytest -q tests/test_decision_evidence_persistence.py tests/test_entry_exit_symmetry.py`
  → `33 passed in 0.09s` (18 new + 15 pre-existing D4 symmetry).
- No existing caller affected: `to_json`/`from_json` are additive
  methods on a frozen dataclass; existing instances continue to work
  unchanged.

### Follow-up: T4.1b

Outstanding: wire `DecisionEvidence.to_json` into entry-path event
emission so `ENTRY_ORDER_POSTED.payload_json` carries a
`decision_evidence` nested key. Requires changes to
`src/engine/evaluator.py` (construct evidence at entry), the
`EdgeDecision → event` chain, and `src/state/lifecycle_events.py`
(or equivalent emission helper). Larger slice, ~3-4h, needs its own
critic review. Flagged for next wave.

## T5.a — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Fix-plan scope said "refactor `place_buy_order` / `place_sell_order` —
real entrypoints at `:191+`". **Seventh plan-premise correction in
this packet**: grep-verified only `place_sell_order` exists at L191
(legacy exit wrapper); `place_buy_order` does NOT exist. Real entry
path is `create_execution_intent → execute_intent → _live_order` at
L135/339. T5.a targets `_live_order` as the final CLOB-contact seam.

### Implementation

1. **Import** `ExecutionPrice, ExecutionPriceContractError` in
   `src/execution/executor.py`.
2. **`_live_order` (L339)**: before calling `client.place_limit_order`,
   construct `ExecutionPrice(value=intent.limit_price, price_type="ask",
   fee_deducted=False, currency="probability_units")`. On ValueError
   / ExecutionPriceContractError, return `OrderResult(status="rejected",
   reason="malformed_limit_price: ...", order_role="entry")` before
   any CLOB contact.
3. **NEW `tests/test_executor_typed_boundary.py`** — 12 tests:
   - 6 reject: NaN, +inf, -inf, negative, 1.5 (>1.0), 2.0
   - 6 accept: 0.0, 0.01, 0.5, 0.75, 0.99, 1.0 (parametrized)

### Three critic findings integrated inline (one-slice closure)

Surrogate `code-reviewer@opus` COMMENT verdict with 1 MEDIUM + 3 LOW:

- **MEDIUM — latent `decision_edge` bug**: `executor.py:136` passed
  `decision_edge=edge.edge` to `ExecutionIntent(...)` and `:428` read
  `intent.decision_edge`, but the dataclass had no such field. Dormant
  because live entries are paused, but the T5.a accept-path tests
  were passing for the WRONG reason (constructor succeeded → hit
  `AttributeError` on `intent.decision_edge` → swallowed by broad
  except → rejection reason ≠ "malformed_limit_price" → assertion
  passed). Fixed inline: added `decision_edge: float = 0.0` to
  `ExecutionIntent` at `src/contracts/execution_intent.py:23`. Test
  fixture updated to pass explicit `decision_edge=0.05`. Tests now
  pass for the RIGHT reason.
- **LOW — semantic white lie**: original `price_type="fee_adjusted",
  fee_deducted=True` construction lied about fee state (executor
  doesn't know upstream fee-accounting). Fixed: `price_type="ask",
  fee_deducted=False` — same finite/nonneg/≤1 guards fire (those are
  `__post_init__` invariants independent of the semantic fields).
- **LOW — misleading reason**: rejection reason was
  `execution_price_contract_violation`, which could mislead readers
  into expecting a Kelly-semantic failure. Renamed to
  `malformed_limit_price` to accurately reflect the narrow structural
  guard.
- **LOW (deferred)** — exit path (`execute_exit_order:269`) has
  unguarded NaN propagation through `max/min` clamp. Out of T5.a
  entry-path scope; flagged for T5.b or equivalent follow-up slice.

### Regression evidence

- `pytest -q tests/test_executor_typed_boundary.py tests/test_execution_price.py`
  → `36 passed, 1 xfailed in 4.60s` (1 xfail pre-existing).
- Broader: `pytest -q tests/test_executor.py tests/test_executor_typed_boundary.py tests/test_execution_price.py tests/test_runtime_guards.py`
  → `15 failed, 148 passed, 1 skipped, 1 xfailed`. All 15 failures
  confirmed pre-existing via `git stash` + rerun (same 15 failures
  without T5.a changes). **Zero delta from T5.a.** Failures are in
  `test_runtime_guards.py` ensemble-snapshot / position-materialization
  territory, unrelated to executor boundary.
- Planning-lock GREEN for `src/execution/executor.py` +
  `src/contracts/execution_intent.py` + test file.

### Scope expansion acknowledged

T5.a initially scoped to "import + boundary assertion + new test
(~4h)". Surrogate critic found that the narrow interpretation would
have shipped tests passing for the wrong reason (decision_edge
AttributeError masquerade). The MEDIUM fix required extending scope
to the `ExecutionIntent` dataclass — a cross-module contract change
— but the fix is additive (one field, default=0.0, preserves every
existing caller). Cross-module risk bounded; the planning-lock check
re-ran with all three files and reported GREEN.

## T1.e — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Three files changed:
- NEW `scripts/test_currency_audit.py` — CI-time guard reading the
  panel list from `architecture/test_topology.yaml::categories.midstream_guardian_panel`,
  scanning each file's first 12 lines for the three canonical
  provenance markers (`# Created:`, `# Last reused/audited:`,
  `# Authority basis:`). Exits 0 if every file carries all 3
  markers; exits 1 with missing-marker list otherwise. Supports
  `--verbose` and `--json` flags.
- `architecture/test_topology.yaml` — new `categories.midstream_guardian_panel:`
  key (nested under existing `categories:` per surrogate-critic D3
  feedback; inherits topology_doctor existing-file validation for free).
- `architecture/script_manifest.yaml` — register the new script as
  `class: enforcement` with canonical command.

Planning-lock GREEN (architecture/** + scripts/**, both under
planning-lock per delivery.md §5).

### Surrogate critic findings (code-reviewer@opus) integrated

Verdict: COMMENT (non-blocking; core enforcement works). 4 findings:

- **D1 (MEDIUM, fixed)**: empty-panel silent-pass regression risk
  → added `len(panel) == 0` guard raising SystemExit.
- **D2 (LOW, fixed)**: malformed YAML threw raw ParserError
  → wrapped in try/except raising clean SystemExit.
- **D3 (LOW, fixed)**: original placement at top-level sibling to
  `categories:` broke topology_doctor convention (both
  `topology_doctor_test_checks.py:24` and
  `topology_doctor_registry_checks.py:126` iterate
  `topology.get("categories")`)
  → nested under `categories:` + script updated to read from
  `data.get("categories").get("midstream_guardian_panel")`.
- **D4 (LOW, deferred)**: regex passes semantic bogus values (e.g.
  `# Created: 0000-00-00`). Acceptable for T1.e scope (header-strip
  detection). Future T1.f/g could add recency bounds.

Critic's positive observations preserved: script eats its own
dogfood (dated provenance header on the audit itself), JSON shape is
clean, `_yaml_bootstrap` reuse + defensive `sys.path.insert` is more
CWD-robust than peer-script convention.

### Regression evidence

- `.venv/bin/python scripts/test_currency_audit.py` → `OK: all 15
  midstream guardian panel files carry dated provenance headers.`
  Exit 0.
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/test_currency_audit.py --json` →
  `{"panel_size": 15, "missing_count": 0, "missing": {}}`.
- Full pytest regression not required — script is pure addition, no
  existing test touched.

## T1.d — audit notes (2026-04-23)

Scope per plan: audit `tests/test_dual_track_law_stubs.py` Phase-N skip
stubs; "Remove activatable; document residuals".

### Grep results

One `pytest.skip` call in the entire file, at `L70` inside
`test_no_high_low_mix_in_platt_or_bins` (function at L68-70).
All other 11 test functions in the file are active:

| Line | Test | Status |
|---|---|---|
| L17 | `test_no_daily_low_on_legacy_table` (NC-11 / INV-14) | active |
| L68 | `test_no_high_low_mix_in_platt_or_bins` (NC-12 / INV-16) | **SKIP** (L70) |
| L74 | `test_json_export_after_db_commit` (NC-13 / INV-17) | active |
| L128 | `test_kelly_input_carries_distributional_info` (NC-14 / INV-21 / DT#5) | active (STRICT Phase 10E) |
| L189 | `test_fdr_family_key_is_canonical` (NC-15 / INV-22) | active (T7.a closed this slot) |
| L227 | `test_red_triggers_active_position_sweep` (INV-19 / DT#2) | active (ACTIVATED Phase 9B) |
| L304 | `test_red_force_exit_marker_drives_evaluate_exit_to_exit` (DT#2) | active |
| L376 | `test_red_force_exit_marker_does_not_override_day0_evaluation` (DT#2) | active |
| L431 | `test_day0_without_red_marker_runs_day0_logic_normally` (DT#2 Phase 9C) | active |
| L477 | `test_boundary_ambiguous_refuses_signal_contract` (DT#7) | active (NEW Phase 9B) |
| L518 | `test_chain_reconciliation_three_state_machine` (INV-18) | active |
| L578 | `test_load_portfolio_degrades_gracefully_on_authority_loss` (INV-20) | active |

### Classification of the L70 stub

**KEEP_LEGITIMATE.**

- INV-16 partial enforcement IS coded in production:
  `src/engine/evaluator.py:922-944` rejects LOW Day0 slots with
  `causality_status` outside `_LOW_ALLOWED_CAUSALITY` (raises
  `"INV-16"`-tagged error). `src/data/observation_client.py:35`
  documents `causality_status` as the INV-16 enforcement mechanism.
- But NC-12 as worded is **multi-surface**: "No mixing of high and
  low rows in Platt model, calibration pair set, bin lookup, or
  settlement identity". INV-16 only covers the Day0 causality aspect.
  Other surfaces (Platt refit input, calibration pair writer, bin
  lookup dispatcher, settlement rebuild identity) are partially coded
  at most.
- V2 substrate (ensemble_snapshots_v2 + calibration_pairs_v2 +
  platt_models_v2) is **empty** per the midstream trust verdict
  substrate audit. There is no mixed-row dataset to test against
  today.
- The skip message "pending: enforced in Phase 7 rebuild" aligns with
  the plan's W5-substrate-deferred classification for related
  slices — Phase 7 is the rebuild packet that populates v2 and
  exercises the multi-surface enforcement end-to-end.

Verdict per memory rule L21 language: neither "activate" nor "extend"
applies — the enforcement-target dataset does not exist today.
**Document and defer.**

### No code changes; slice closes with this work_log + receipt entry.

## T2.a/T2.b — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Both tests in `tests/test_calibration_bins_canonical.py` (plan cited
as T2.a and T2.b separately, but they share fixture assumptions and
fix together as a pair):

- `test_R14_quarantine_allows_replacement_tag` (L758)
- `test_R14_filter_allowed_partitions_rows` (L776)

### Direction: tests were stale, code is current

Authority source `src/contracts/ensemble_snapshot_provenance.py:26-28,
82-103, 118-147` declares:
- `tigge_mx2t6_local_peak_window_max_v1` is EXPLICITLY quarantined
  (exact match + prefix match)
- Canonical dual-track replacements are
  `tigge_mx2t6_local_calendar_day_max_v1` (HIGH_LOCALDAY_MAX) and
  `tigge_mn2t6_local_calendar_day_min_v1` (LOW_LOCALDAY_MIN), both
  in `CANONICAL_DATA_VERSIONS` frozenset at L68-71
- `assert_data_version_allowed` has two-stage check: (1) quarantine
  block at L131-140, (2) positive allowlist at L141-147

Previous fixture expected `peak_window_max_v1` to be "allowed
replacement" — directly contradicted by both quarantine entries. The
other fixture items (`"day_window_max_v1"`, openmeteo, empty, None)
all fail the stage-2 positive allowlist. Whole assertion path was
broken.

### Changes

- `test_R14_quarantine_allows_replacement_tag`: now iterates
  `sorted(CANONICAL_DATA_VERSIONS)` (the authoritative frozenset),
  asserts each passes both stages. Docstring documents authority
  source.
- `test_R14_filter_allowed_partitions_rows`: updated expected
  partitioning. Old: `allowed=[1, 4], quarantined=[2, 3]`. New:
  `allowed=[4], quarantined=[1, 2, 3]`. Docstring explains id 4
  (openmeteo) passes `is_quarantined` (no prefix/exact match) but
  would still fail `assert_data_version_allowed` stage-2; `filter_allowed`
  is reader-side, only checks quarantine.

### Regression evidence

- Narrow: `pytest -q tests/test_calibration_bins_canonical.py::test_R14_quarantine_allows_replacement_tag tests/test_calibration_bins_canonical.py::test_R14_filter_allowed_partitions_rows` → `2 passed in 0.77s`.
- File: `pytest -q tests/test_calibration_bins_canonical.py` → `40 passed in 1.44s`. Zero regression.

### Surrogate critic (code-reviewer@opus)

Verdict: CLEAR, APPROVE.
- DIRECTION_CORRECT: yes — independently grep-verified source
  quarantine + corroborated by `tests/test_phase4_parity_gate.py:26-66`
  and `tests/test_phase4_rebuild.py:266-281`.
- MISSED_SITES: none in tests/ or src/ that reference the old "allowed"
  assumption.
- COVERAGE_LOSS: acceptable / arguably improved (old test was exercising
  code paths that SHOULD fail stage-2 allowlist).
- CITATION_STALENESS: none (L87, L102, L26-28, L141 all fresh).

### Flagged follow-up (out-of-T2.a scope)

Critic flagged stale comment at
`scripts/rebuild_calibration_pairs_canonical.py:103-104`:
> "The future `tigge_mx2t6_local_peak_window_max_v1` data_version is
> intentionally NOT quarantined — it is the replacement target."

This contradicts current contract. Not a test blocker but a
documentation-antibody gap. Flagged as a MEDIUM follow-up slice.

## T7.a — verification notes (2026-04-23)

Fourth plan-premise correction in this packet. Plan said:
> "Activate `test_fdr_family_key_is_canonical` — remove `pytest.skip` at
> `tests/test_dual_track_law_stubs.py:67` + verify body matches
> `make_hypothesis_family_id` + `make_edge_family_id` signatures"

Reality (grep-verified 2026-04-23):
- Line 67 is a comment (`# NC-12 / INV-16`).
- Line 70 is `pytest.skip("pending: enforced in Phase 7 rebuild")` inside
  `test_no_high_low_mix_in_platt_or_bins` (a DIFFERENT test, NC-12 /
  INV-16 enforcement for Phase 7). That stub is T1.d territory.
- `test_fdr_family_key_is_canonical` is at L189 with no skip decorators
  and a full body covering:
  - hypothesis vs edge family ID scope separation
  - determinism within each scope
  - metric discrimination (HIGH ≠ LOW family IDs per S4 R9 P10B)
- Verified passing: `pytest -q tests/test_dual_track_law_stubs.py::test_fdr_family_key_is_canonical`
  → `1 passed in 0.03s`.

Slice scope is satisfied without code changes. Receipt documents the
verified-already-done state. Per memory rule L21, "activate" was the
wrong verb in the plan — the test was already active. This is being
recorded as CLOSED with NO-OP commit (this work_log + receipt update
only).

The residual `test_no_high_low_mix_in_platt_or_bins` skip stub is
flagged for T1.d closure.

## T3.2 — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Scope: add `"temperature_metric": "high"` to `_canonical_projection()`
helper at `tests/test_architecture_contracts.py:125-157`. One line,
resolves ≥5 failing tests via single category patch (Fitz C1).

Pre-T3.2 state (test_architecture_contracts.py, post-T3.3): ~9 failures
with `ValueError: projection missing fields: ['temperature_metric']`.

Post-T3.2: **1 failed / 70 passed / 22 skipped**. Remaining failure is
`test_cycle_runtime_entry_dual_write_helper_skips_when_canonical_schema_absent`
→ `AttributeError: '_Logger' object has no attribute 'warning'` at
`src/engine/cycle_runtime.py:291`. Unrelated to fixture drift.

Surrogate critic (code-reviewer@opus): CLEAR. Confirmed `_canonical_event()`
correctly NOT patched — `CANONICAL_POSITION_EVENT_COLUMNS` does not
include `temperature_metric`. Fitz C1 compliance on "one fixture × five
callers = one patch" verified.

## T3.2b — execution notes (2026-04-23)

**Plan-premise correction (third in this packet):** fix-plan v2 T3.2b
scope was "AST-walk `src/state/projection.py` builders". Grep-verified
`src/state/projection.py` has ZERO dict-returning functions — all
functions return `None`, `tuple`, `set`, or raise. The AST-walk target
is vacuous.

Pivoted to structural-alignment antibodies that catch the drift
category responsible for T3.2 failures:
- Test 1: `temperature_metric in CANONICAL_POSITION_CURRENT_COLUMNS`
  (Python-tuple drift)
- Test 2: kernel SQL CREATE TABLE declares `temperature_metric` (SQL
  migration drift)
- Test 3: every `CANONICAL_POSITION_CURRENT_COLUMNS` entry appears in
  kernel SQL CREATE TABLE (constant ↔ schema alignment) — the real
  category-immunity antibody per Fitz C1

New file `tests/test_canonical_position_current_schema_alignment.py`
passes 3/3. Carries dated provenance header per CLAUDE.md rule.

Surrogate critic adopted: regex hardening from `\n\)\s*;` to `\)\s*;`
(drops `\n` anchor for robustness against future migration reformatting).

Critic flagged 3 low-severity future-slice antibody targets (F1-F3):
- `CANONICAL_POSITION_EVENT_COLUMNS` three-way drift (test ↔ ledger ↔ kernel SQL)
- `LifecyclePhase` Python enum ↔ `phase` CHECK constraint
- `event_type` scatter without central Python enum

All noted for potential future slices — not blocking T3.2b.

## T3.3 — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Fix-plan premise correction (third such correction in this packet, after
T4.0 and implicit T3.2 overlap):

**Plan said**: "Canonical `position_current` schema bootstrap fix. Diff
`apply_architecture_kernel_schema()` against
`CANONICAL_POSITION_CURRENT_COLUMNS`; add missing columns to bootstrap
SQL."

**Reality (factually verified)**: the kernel migration at
`architecture/2026_04_02_architecture_kernel.sql:82-129` CREATE TABLE
already declares all 31 canonical columns. A fresh DB probe via
`sqlite3 :memory: + apply_architecture_kernel_schema(conn)` yields
exactly 31 columns, zero missing, zero extra. **Bootstrap is already
correct.**

The actual defect is in the LEGACY-DB migration path (not fresh
bootstrap): when `apply_architecture_kernel_schema` runs on an
existing-but-pre-kernel `position_current` table, the
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` no-ops, and the explicit ALTER TABLE
loop at L147-149 only adds 3 token columns. Missing canonical columns
like `temperature_metric` remain absent, causing
`assert_canonical_transaction_schema` at L150 to raise.

### Fix

Expanded the ALTER TABLE loop to iterate over all
`CANONICAL_POSITION_CURRENT_COLUMNS` (not just the 3-tuple), adding
each missing column with plain TEXT affinity. Cached the column set
once before the loop (idempotency correctness confirmed by critic).
Multi-line comment explains the design trade-off (TEXT affinity +
runtime `require_payload_fields` guard).

### Critic review (surrogate code-reviewer@opus)

**Verdict: CLEAR — APPROVE for commit.**

Findings summary:
- F1 (low, non-blocking): TEXT affinity for REAL-typed legacy columns —
  documented trade-off; SQLite dynamic typing preserves values.
- F2 (low, non-blocking): INV-14 CHECK constraint lost for
  ALTER-migrated `temperature_metric`, but runtime guard at
  `src/state/projection.py:50-53` catches invalid writes BEFORE the
  DB; critic greped `nuke_rebuild_projections.py:124` as the only
  direct-SQL mutator and confirmed it touches only `phase`+`updated_at`.
- F3, F4: positive observations on idempotency and inline documentation.

All seven rubric axes: CORRECTNESS pass, TYPE_SEMANTICS acceptable,
IDEMPOTENCY correct, ORDERING safe, INV_14_CONSEQUENCE preserved,
PLANNING_LOCK verified green (path correction noted), TEST_EXPECTATION
fixed target green, no new regression.

### Regression evidence

- `pytest -q tests/test_architecture_contracts.py::test_kernel_schema_adds_token_identity_columns_to_existing_position_current`
  → passes (was failing pre-T3.3).
- `pytest -q tests/test_architecture_contracts.py::test_kernel_schema_migrates_existing_token_suppression_reason_check`
  → passes (not regressed).
- `pytest -q tests/test_architecture_contracts.py::test_apply_architecture_kernel_schema_bootstraps_fresh_db`
  → still fails, but the failure is on `_canonical_projection()` missing
  `temperature_metric` field in the fixture — T3.2 scope, not T3.3.
  My T3.3 change is orthogonal.

## T3.1 — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Scope per plan: "patch ALL 7 execute_discovery_phase callers in
tests/ + audit materialize_position callers". L20 grep-gate resolved
the true call-site inventory to **5 patches**, not 7:

- `tests/test_day0_runtime_observation_context.py:41` (MISSING env)
- `tests/test_day0_runtime_observation_context.py:84` (MISSING env)
- `tests/test_runtime_guards.py:717` already has `env="paper"` — NO PATCH
- `tests/test_runtime_guards.py:4877` (MISSING env) — DAY0_CAPTURE mode
- `tests/test_runtime_guards.py:5027` (MISSING env) — OPENING_HUNT mode
- `tests/test_architecture_contracts.py:3555` (MISSING env) — UPDATE_REACTION
- `tests/test_phase10e_closeout.py:352` resolved to a FUNCTION NAME,
  not a call — the grep hit was on `def test_r_df_5_*`, not on an
  actual `execute_discovery_phase(...)` invocation. No patch needed.
- `tests/test_runtime_guards.py:2010, 2057` (materialize_position)
  already carry `state="entered", env="paper"` — NO PATCH.

Applied uniform `env="paper"` to all 5 missing sites. Paper is the
safe test-context value per the pattern already established at
`test_runtime_guards.py:717`. Real production uses `env="live"` for
live runs.

Regression evidence (delta-direction per memory L28):
- Targeted tests:
  - `pytest -q tests/test_day0_runtime_observation_context.py`
    → `4 passed` (was 2 failed, 2 passed)
  - 4 T3.1-target tests (entry_path × 2, discovery_phase_records × 2)
    → `4 passed`
- Broader 3-file regression:
  - Pre-T3.1 baseline: 28 failed / 166 passed / 22 skipped
    (normalized to same 3 files as post-run by subtracting
    test_phase10e_closeout.py's 13 passing tests from the 4-file
    pre-run)
  - Post-T3.1: **22 failed / 172 passed / 22 skipped**
  - Delta: **-6 failures, +6 passes, 0 new failures**
- Remaining 22 failures on these files are out-of-T3.1-scope:
  T3.3 schema bootstrap (apply_architecture_kernel_schema,
  kernel_schema_adds_token_identity_columns, cycle_runtime_entry_dual_write_helper),
  T2.g fail-closed (test_fdr already handled), INV-08 atomicity,
  unrelated INV-14 projection drift → owned by T3.2, T3.2b, T3.3, T2.g.

## T1.b — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Scope per plan: "content audit of `config/provenance_registry.yaml`
(already exists at 516 lines) + remove redundant `skipif` markers in
`test_provenance_enforcement.py`."

Findings:
- `config/provenance_registry.yaml` exists and is populated (≥ 516
  lines, `kelly_mult` at L26, `market_fusion.TAIL_ALPHA_SCALE` present,
  required fields `declared_target, data_basis, validated_at,
  replacement_criteria` all present per registry shape).
- All 4 tests in `TestAllStrategyConstantsRegistered` carry TWO
  skipif markers:
  1. `skipif(not REGISTRY_YAML.exists(), reason="Registry YAML not yet created")` — **inaccurate today**: file exists. Removed by T1.b.
  2. `skipif(not HAS_YAML, reason="PyYAML not installed")` — **legitimate environmental check**: PyYAML may be absent in minimal Python envs; kept.
- L34 inside `_load_registry_yaml()` helper also references
  `REGISTRY_YAML.exists()` — kept (legitimate fallback, returns empty
  dict when file absent).

Per memory rule L21, this is **REMOVING STALE SKIP MARKERS**, not
"activating" tests — all 4 guarded tests already ran in the pre-T1.b
baseline because both skip conditions evaluated False. The slice
hardens the test against future regressions (if the registry file is
deleted, tests will now fail loudly instead of silent-skipping).

Regression evidence: `pytest -q tests/test_provenance_enforcement.py`
→ `19 passed in 0.15s` (matches pre-T1.b baseline exactly).

## T1.a — execution notes (2026-04-23)

Prepended a 3-line dated provenance header to each file in the
15-file midstream guardian panel. Created dates retrieved via
`git log --follow --reverse --format=%cs -- <file> | head -1`.
Authority basis uniform across the panel: "midstream verdict v2
2026-04-23 (docs/to-do-list/zeus_midstream_fix_plan_2026-04-23.md T1.a
midstream guardian panel)". Per-test specific INV references remain
inside each file's own module docstring (unchanged).

Regression verdict (L28 delta-direction, not absolute counts):
- **narrow scope (15 panel files)**: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
  <15 files>` → `19 failed, 344 passed, 34 skipped, 1 xfailed` —
  matches the pre-T1.a baseline documented in the midstream trust
  verdict (K2 findings). **Zero delta.** Confirms comment-only change
  had no test-behavior impact.
- **full-suite probe**: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/` →
  `144 failed, 2079 passed, 90 skipped, 1 xfailed`. Out-of-scope for
  T1.a closure — these failures exist independently of the 15-file
  panel and are attributable to pre-existing repo state and/or the
  concurrent upstream data-readiness agent. Noted for context; not a
  T1.a regression.

Files changed: 15 test files (3-line header prepend each), plus this
work_log.md + receipt.json. `tests/AGENTS.md` is also modified in the
tree but is **not mine** (co-tenant's work); NOT staged for this
commit.

## T4.0 — PROPOSAL notes (2026-04-23, rev2)

### Premise correction
Fix-plan v2 T4.0 row states "`decision_log` row keyed on
`decision_snapshot_id` (option b; no schema migration)". Grep-verified
at `src/state/db.py:528-536` shows `decision_log` has 6 columns
(`id, mode, started_at, completed_at, artifact_json, timestamp`) with
**no `decision_snapshot_id`**. Premise is false.

### Revision history
- **rev1 (earlier today)**: Picked Option B (new column
  `decision_evidence_json TEXT` on `trade_decisions`). Reviewed by
  surrogate critic (code-reviewer@opus).
- **rev2 (this entry)**: Integrates surrogate critic findings F1-F3
  + missed Option E. Recommendation flipped to Option E.

### Surrogate critic findings integrated
- **F1 HIGH**: rev1 cited `evaluator.py:724, 1307` as Decision handoff
  sites. Actual: FDR-filter logic. `EdgeDecision` (not `Decision`)
  is constructed at L753, 778, 803, 815, 832, 842, 866, 882, 901, 912.
- **F2 MED**: rev1 cited `db.py:2320, 2468` as INSERT sites. Actual:
  VALUES-tuple entries; INSERTs at L2325, L2473.
- **F3 HIGH**: rev1 asserted atomicity between `trade_decisions`
  INSERT and `position_events` append. Grep-verified WRONG via
  `cycle_runtime.py:1115-1140`'s explicit SAVEPOINT-then-dual-write
  comment. `trade_decisions` INSERT lives inside
  `SAVEPOINT sp_candidate_*`; `position_events` append
  (`append_many_and_project`) runs after SAVEPOINT release with its
  own `with conn:` sub-transaction. **Separate transaction boundaries;
  torn-state window exists today for `epistemic_context_json` and
  `edge_context_json`.** Option B inherits this window.
- **Missed Option E**: Piggyback on existing
  `ENTRY_ORDER_POSTED.payload_json` — `payload_json` NOT NULL TEXT
  column at `position_events` col 17 already exists (PRAGMA-verified).
  Atomic with canonical append. No schema change. No INV-07 expansion.

### Recommendation flipped: Option E

Option E is structurally superior on three axes:
1. Atomicity: evidence lands in the same canonical
   `append_many_and_project` transaction.
2. Zero schema migration: `payload_json` already exists.
3. Category immunity per Fitz C1: future decision-contract evidence
   extends the same payload-sidecar pattern.

### Planning-lock classification
REQUIRED for T4.1 per delivery.md §5. "Additive/non-breaking" is
not an exemption. Option E keeps T4.1 out of `src/state/db.py` schema
but still touches `src/engine/evaluator.py` + `src/state/lifecycle_events.py`
(or equivalent emission helper) — both under planning-lock trigger
zones.

### contract_version tag
ADOPT. `DecisionEvidence.to_json` emits
`{"contract_version": 1, "fields": {...}}`.
`from_json` raises `UnknownContractVersionError` on unknown versions.

### Open questions for con-nyx (durable critic)
1. Idempotency when `ENTRY_ORDER_POSTED` is retried: key on
   `decision_id`?
2. Helper location: `decision_chain.py` vs new
   `decision_evidence_persistence.py`?
3. Does `query_position_events` accept `runtime_trade_id` or
   `position_id`?
