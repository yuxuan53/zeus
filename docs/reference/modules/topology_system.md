# Topology System

> Status: reference, not authority. See `AGENTS.md`, `workspace_map.md`, `architecture/**`, and `docs/authority/**` for authority.

## Purpose

The topology system is Zeus's machine-readable governance and routing kernel. It tells agents what law to read, which files are in scope, what companions are required, which manifest owns each fact type, and which failures block a given mode.

## Authority anchors

- Root `AGENTS.md` requires topology navigation before code changes.
- `workspace_map.md` defines default route and visibility classes.
- `architecture/topology.yaml`, `zones.yaml`, `invariants.yaml`, and `negative_constraints.yaml` define the durable kernel.
- `architecture/docs_registry.yaml`, `module_manifest.yaml`, `source_rationale.yaml`, `test_topology.yaml`, and `script_manifest.yaml` define registries.
- `scripts/topology_doctor.py` and `tests/test_topology_doctor.py` enforce and regress the kernel.

## How it works

Topology has five interacting layers:

1. **Authority surfaces**: system/developer/user instructions, root/scoped AGENTS, authority docs, manifests, tests, and executable source.
2. **Routing manifests**: compact machine facts about files, zones, docs, modules, tests, scripts, graph, and context budget.
3. **Validator lanes**: topology doctor checks that expose drift and missing companions.
4. **Mode policies**: navigation, closeout, strict/global health, context pack, and packet prefill use different blocking rules.
5. **Cognition surfaces**: module books and derived appendices explain hidden obligations without becoming law.

## Hidden obligations

- Topology indexes authority; it never outranks source, tests, canonical DB/event truth, or current law.
- Archives are accessed through `docs/archive_registry.md` and are not default-read.
- Planning lock applies to architecture/governance/control/lifecycle/cross-zone and broad file changes.
- Machine manifests should stay compact; module books carry explanation.
- Global health drift must remain visible even when a scoped route is clear.

## Failure modes

- Lane conflation makes unrelated repo-health drift block a focused task.
- Flat issue shapes make repair ownership impossible to automate.
- Dense knowledge remains hidden in tests, package plans, source comments, or graph blobs.
- A tidy manifest layer becomes cognitively hollow and causes zero-context agents to guess.

## Repair routes

- Start with `python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --navigation --task "<task>" --files <files>`.
- Use typed issue `owner_manifest` and `repair_kind` metadata to select the owning registry.
- Stop and plan when planning-lock or unknown ownership appears.
- Close with changed-file `closeout`, targeted tests, and explicit work/receipt evidence.
