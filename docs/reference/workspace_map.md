# Zeus Workspace Map

> Status: Orientation-only and archive-aware map, not principal authority.
> Current authority order is defined in `architecture/self_check/authority_index.md`.
> Current repo operating rules are defined in `AGENTS.md`.
> Historical material moved under `docs/archives/**` is not active authority.

| `tests/test_pnl_flow_and_audit.py` | P&L data flow chain invariants |
| `tests/test_*.py` | Function and lifecycle tests |

## `scripts/` — One-Time Operations

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `migrate_rainstorm_data.py` | Import data from rainstorm.db |
| `backfill_ens.py` | 93-day ENS P_raw backfill |
| `baseline_experiment.py` | Phase 0 GO/NO-GO gate |
| `healthcheck.py` | Daemon alive/dead check (Venus cron target) |
| `etl_*.py` | Data ETL from rainstorm.db / TIGGE / other sources |

## `logs/` — Daemon Logs

`zeus-paper.log`, `zeus-paper.err` — rotated by launchd.

## Archive boundary

- Historical handoffs, sessions, findings, traces, research, and reports now live under `docs/archives/`.
- Retired root/architects control ledgers live under `docs/archives/control/`.
- Completed work packets live under `docs/archives/work_packets/`; only the current live packet remains in `docs/work_packets/`.
- Retired root artifacts and historical top-level designs/reports live under `docs/archives/artifacts/`, `docs/archives/designs/`, `docs/archives/migration/`, and `docs/archives/reports/`.
- Do not treat archived files as live control surfaces unless a new packet explicitly promotes them.

## What Does NOT Belong in Zeus Workspace

- Rainstorm source code (lives in `workspace-venus/rainstorm/`)
- TIGGE raw data (lives in `workspace-venus/51 source data/`)
- Session prompts, code review docs (live in `project level docs/archive/`)
- OpenClaw central config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`)
- Venus agent identity files (live in `workspace-venus/` root)
