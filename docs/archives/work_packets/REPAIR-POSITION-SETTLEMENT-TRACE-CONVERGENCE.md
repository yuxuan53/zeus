# REPAIR-POSITION-SETTLEMENT-TRACE-CONVERGENCE

```yaml
work_packet_id: REPAIR-POSITION-SETTLEMENT-TRACE-CONVERGENCE
packet_type: repair_packet
objective: Eliminate close-path trace loss between `position_current`, `positions-paper.json`, and `chronicle` so exited/settled positions stop remaining falsely open and settlement history carries durable `exit_price`.
why_this_now: VERIFY-ETL-RECALIBRATE-CONTAMINATION is accepted and its post-close gate passed. The next highest-priority leftover family is position/state/settlement trace convergence. Fresh live repo truth shows a concrete contradiction on this seam: `positions-paper.json` currently has 14 `recent_exits` whose trade_ids still remain open in `position_current` (5 `day0_window`, 9 `active`), and all 19 paper `chronicle` settlement rows are missing `exit_price`. This means the discovered→bought→exited→settled chain is still split across runtime/read surfaces.
why_not_other_approach:
  - Diagnose `center_buy` first | strategy diagnosis is downstream of lower-layer trace truth and would still read contaminated close-path state
  - Patch only reader filters or only write-side dual-write | reader-only would keep future corruption alive; write-only would leave current runtime truth contradicted by existing terminal trade_decisions rows
  - Widen into broad canonical migration cleanup | this packet should stay on the concrete close-path divergence, not reopen every stale seam
truth_layer: `position_current` open exposure, `positions-paper.json` runtime state, `trade_decisions` terminal statuses, `chronicle` settlement details, and canonical close-path events must stop contradicting each other on whether a position is still open and at what exit price it closed.
control_layer: limit the repair to close-path read/write seams in `src/state/db.py`, `src/state/portfolio.py`, `src/engine/lifecycle_events.py`, `src/execution/exit_lifecycle.py`, `src/execution/harvester.py`, and packet-bounded tests proving stale-open exclusion, future economic-close canonical updates, and chronicle `exit_price` durability. Do not widen into risk/status/operator summaries, migrations, ETL, or strategy diagnosis.
evidence_layer: work-packet grammar output, kernel-manifest check output, targeted trace-convergence pytest output, and a direct live SQL/JSON truth note showing pre-repair contradiction and post-repair convergence on the touched seam.

parity_required: false

rollback: Revert the trace-convergence edits and paired tests/control-surface updates together; repo returns to the current accepted ETL packet boundary with stale-open projections and chronicle `exit_price` loss still explicitly open.
acceptance:
  - close-path readers (`query_portfolio_loader_view` / open-status views) no longer surface positions as open when the latest durable terminal truth already says they exited or settled
  - future economic-close path updates canonical close-path truth on the touched seam instead of leaving `position_current` stranded at entry/open phases
  - harvester settlement chronicle writes now carry `exit_price`
  - targeted tests pass and the control surfaces record the packet boundary truthfully

  - kernel-manifest check output

  - direct live SQL/JSON truth note
```

## Notes

- This packet stays on the concrete close-path seam only: stale-open projection exclusion, future economic-close canonical updates, and chronicle settlement `exit_price` durability.
- Degraded-path rule for this packet: if a canonical position has no prior event history, the touched code may skip append-first terminal dual-write only when that skip is explicit and does not pretend the position remained open.
- If implementation shows the fix needs migration scripts, broad historical backfill, or risk/status/operator rewrites, stop and freeze a new packet instead of widening this one.

## Evidence log

- direct live SQL/JSON truth note:
  - pre-repair live inspection on `/Users/leofitz/.openclaw/workspace-venus/zeus/state` showed all 14 `positions-paper.json` `recent_exits` trade_ids still present in `position_current` open phases and all 19 paper `chronicle` settlement rows missing `exit_price`
  - post-repair reader probe with patched code against the same live state shows `recent_exit_trade_ids_still_open_after_reader_repair = 0`
  - post-repair `load_portfolio()` on the live `positions-paper.json` path returns `12` positions with state counts `{economically_closed: 9, entered: 3}` because `query_portfolio_loader_view()` now returns `stale_legacy_fallback` and cleanly falls back to JSON rather than surfacing contradicted canonical-open rows
