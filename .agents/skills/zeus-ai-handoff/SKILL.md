name: zeus-ai-handoff
description: General-purpose handoff workflow for Zeus — covers any AI-to-AI or session-to-session handoff. Selects the right execution mode (direct / subagent / longlast multi-batch / adversarial debate) per task scale + risk; preserves Zeus authority surfaces; encodes proven discipline (disk-first, critic-gate, bidirectional grep, co-tenant git hygiene, verdict erratum). Use when adapting a Zeus change of any size, converting a request into a packet-ready plan, preparing a handoff bundle, or starting a multi-batch execution across longlast teammates. Replaces v1 single-mode workflow with a 4-mode playbook validated by Tier 1 + 3-round debate cycle 2026-04-27.

# Zeus AI Handoff (v2)

## Purpose

Convert a Zeus task — at any scale, from quick fix to multi-week refactor — into structured handoff truth without overriding Zeus authority files or treating any single artifact (zip, doc, debate verdict) as canonical truth.

This is the **outer workflow layer** for Zeus. The inner authority remains:
- Root `AGENTS.md` + `workspace_map.md`
- Scoped `AGENTS.md` files per package
- `architecture/**` machine manifests
- `docs/authority/**` constitutional surfaces

This SKILL selects which **execution mode** fits the task, then applies mode-specific discipline.

---

## §1 Required Reads (always)

1. `AGENTS.md` (root)
2. `workspace_map.md`
3. `docs/runbooks/task_2026-04-19_ai_workflow_bridge.md` (handoff context)
4. `python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --navigation --task "<task>" --files <files>`

When pipeline/architecture/governance work:
5. `docs/operations/current_state.md`
6. `docs/methodology/adversarial_debate_for_project_evaluation.md` (if mode D)
7. `.claude/skills/zeus-phase-discipline/SKILL.md` (if mode C / multi-batch)

If navigation is blocked by pre-existing registry issues, record that as workspace state and keep the handoff change narrow.

---

## §2 Zeus Mapping (do-NOTs from v1, preserved)

- Do NOT copy a generic starter-kit `AGENTS.md` over Zeus root `AGENTS.md`
- Do NOT copy starter `src/` or `tests/` placeholder directories
- Do NOT put generic starter docs directly under `docs/`; use an active packet folder under `docs/operations/task_YYYY-MM-DD_slug/` or a runbook/reference route
- Do NOT add top-level `scripts/` helpers without updating `architecture/script_manifest.yaml`
- Treat handoff zips/bundles as guidance, not source snapshots or canonical truth

---

## §3 Mode selection (the new decision branch)

Before choosing artifacts or dispatching, pick ONE mode based on task profile:

| Task profile | Mode | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Single file edit, ≤30 min, reversible | **A. Direct** | No handoff overhead needed |
| 1-3 files, clear spec, ≤2h, low stakes | **B. Subagent** | One-shot Agent dispatch with explicit task |
| Multi-batch (4+ items), implementation pipeline, K0/K1 zone touched | **C. Longlast executor + critic-gate** | Tier 1 pattern; per-batch critic verdict before next |
| High-stakes architecture/strategy decision; multiple valid approaches; team disagreement | **D. Adversarial debate** | 3-round methodology in `docs/methodology/adversarial_debate_for_project_evaluation.md` |

**Default if uncertain**: B (subagent) for mid-size; C if >4 files or multi-week.

**Anti-pattern**: using D (full debate) for what should be A or B is the most common mistake — wastes 70+ min on a 30-min decision. Use methodology §11 ROI signals to check.

---

## §4 Requirement Tribunal (applies to all modes ≥ B)

When the request is broad, underspecified, or likely to touch architecture / governance / source truth / lifecycle / DB authority / cross-zone:

Maintain four buckets:
- **Facts** (what is true on HEAD)
- **Decisions** (what we choose given the facts)
- **Open Questions** (unresolved; need operator or empirical resolution)
- **Risks** (what could go wrong + mitigation)

End this phase only when the next artifact can state: objective, non-goals, invariants, likely-touched surfaces, verification commands, rollback note, authority/truth boundaries.

---

## §5 Handoff Document Set (per mode)

**Mode A (Direct)**: no handoff docs; just edit + commit + verify.

**Mode B (Subagent)**: `task_packet.md` in active packet folder; include the 7-item Execution Prompt Shape (§7).

**Mode C (Longlast multi-batch)**: full set:
- `project_brief.md` — context + goal
- `prd.md` — requirements
- `architecture_note.md` — design choices
- `implementation_plan.md` — phased breakdown (which batches, dependencies)
- `task_packet.md` — operator-facing summary
- `verification_plan.md` — per-phase + final acceptance criteria
- `decisions.md` — rationale ledger
- `not_now.md` — explicit out-of-scope
- `work_log.md` — chronological execution record

**Mode D (Adversarial debate)**: per `docs/methodology/adversarial_debate_for_project_evaluation.md` §2: TOPIC.md + judge_ledger.md + per-round evidence + verdict.md.

Use only the subset the task actually needs.

## §6 Execution mode mechanics

### §6.A Direct
1. Edit / commit / verify
2. `git add` specific files (NEVER `-A` with co-tenant active per memory `feedback_no_git_add_all_with_cotenant`)
3. Commit message via HEREDOC; verify with `git log -1`

### §6.B Subagent
1. Spawn Agent (general-purpose, model per CLAUDE.md routing)
2. Provide §7 Execution Prompt Shape verbatim
3. Receive output; verify; commit per §6.A

### §6.C Longlast executor + critic-gate (Tier 1 pattern)
1. Spawn `executor-<topic>` (longlast, model=opus for HIGH risk else sonnet, team_name)
2. Spawn `critic-<topic>` (longlast, opus, team_name) — independent, gates each batch
3. Per batch:
   - Executor: write changes; SendMessage `BATCH_X_DONE`
   - Critic: independent review (10-attack template); SendMessage `BATCH_X_REVIEW APPROVE/REVISE/BLOCK`
   - Team-lead: dispatch next batch only after critic APPROVE
4. Honor methodology §5 critic-gate workflow

### §6.D Adversarial debate (if Mode D selected)
Follow `docs/methodology/adversarial_debate_for_project_evaluation.md` end-to-end (§2 setup → §3 mechanics → §8 verdict structure). Mode D is reserved for high-stakes multi-valid-approach decisions; methodology §0 has the ROI signals.

---

## §7 Execution Prompt Shape (for Mode B / batch dispatch in Mode C)

When handing a task to a coding surface:

1. Current Zeus authority reads + topology command
2. Single task objective (one sentence)
3. Files and zones likely involved
4. Invariants that must NOT move
5. Not-now list
6. Required verification + rollback note
7. Instruction to preserve unrelated dirty work (co-tenant safe staging)

**Mode C addition**: also specify (a) which batch this is in the multi-batch plan, (b) the SendMessage status format expected, (c) the critic that will review.

---

## §8 Discipline patterns (apply across all modes ≥ B)

These are PROVEN patterns from Tier 1 + 3-round debate cycle 2026-04-27. Bake into every handoff:

### §8.1 Disk-first
Every artifact lands on disk BEFORE SendMessage notification. SendMessage delivery is asymmetric and can drop silently (memory `feedback_converged_results_to_disk`); disk is canonical record. Recovery: if a teammate goes idle without SendMessage, **disk-poll** the expected output file path; if found, treat as delivered.

### §8.2 file:line citations grep-verified within 10 min
Before any "lock" event (concession, contract, dispatch, commit), every file:line reference must be grep-re-verified. Citations rot fast (~20-30% premise mismatch in 1 week per memory `feedback_zeus_plan_citations_rot_fast`). Use symbol-anchored citations (function name + sentinel comment) where possible — surveys line-number drift.

### §8.3 Bidirectional grep before "X% of Y lack Z" claims
Forward grep (manifest cites field?) AND reverse grep (target system back-cites identity?). Schema-citation gap (forward only) ≠ enforcement gap (both). Apply to ANY % claim. See `.claude/skills/zeus-phase-discipline/SKILL.md` "During implementation" + methodology §5.X case study.

### §8.4 Co-tenant git staging
With multiple agents/sessions active in shared repo:
- `git add` SPECIFIC files; never `-A` or `.`
- `git diff --cached --name-only` before commit; verify scope
- `git restore --staged <file>` for anything unintentionally staged
- HEREDOC commit message; verify with `git log -1` after

### §8.5 Per-batch critic-gate
Executor must NOT self-approve over multi-batch work. Independent critic dispatched in parallel. Team-lead waits for critic APPROVE before next dispatch. Memory `feedback_executor_commit_boundary_gate`.

### §8.6 Idle-only bootstrap
Spawn longlast teammates with idle-only boot prompt: read context → write boot evidence → SendMessage BOOT_ACK → idle. Substantive work only after team-lead dispatches. Memory `feedback_idle_only_bootstrap`.

### §8.7 Verdict-level erratum pattern
When implementation discovers prior debate / verdict / plan was based on incomplete evidence:
- Do NOT silently fix
- Append explicit POST-IMPLEMENTATION ERRATUM to the verdict noting: original claim, what audit found, what changes (and what doesn't change)
- Update referenced artifacts with CITATION_REPAIR comments
- Add to methodology if pattern is reusable

Methodological transparency compounds across cycles.

## §9 Common failure modes (recovery procedures)

| # | Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Teammate idle, no SendMessage | SendMessage dropped | Disk-poll expected output path |
| F2 | Teammate flags MISROUTE_FLAG | Judge meta-tasks polluted team task list | Delete misleading tasks; track meta in judge_ledger only |
| F3 | Teammate idle without producing | Role unclear in dispatch | Re-dispatch with explicit "YOUR ROLE" + numbered steps + literal SendMessage template |
| F4 | Path corrections from teammate | Dispatch cited paths that moved | Acknowledge corrections; adopt teammate paths as canonical |
| F5 | Co-tenant staged work absorbed into commit | `git add -A` or `.` used | `git diff --cached --name-only` BEFORE commit; `git restore --staged` to fix |
| F6 | Documented baseline ≠ live | Baseline drifted between docs and now | Critic re-measures LIVE at boot; uses LIVE for checks; documents drift |
| F7 | Verdict claim falsified post-implementation | Debate-stage audit was incomplete | Erratum pattern §8.7 |
| F8 | Implementation drift from documented design | Execution copy of "obvious choice" diverges from documented choice | Cross-batch arithmetic equivalence audit (critic role); fix to match documented design |

## §10 Completion Gate

Before calling the handoff ready (any mode):

- [ ] Open questions resolved or explicitly blocking
- [ ] Not-now items explicit
- [ ] Verification commands concrete
- [ ] Rollback / blast radius stated
- [ ] Any new file registered in scoped mesh (`architecture/script_manifest.yaml` for scripts, `architecture/source_rationale.yaml` for src/, `architecture/test_topology.yaml` for tests/, scoped AGENTS.md for routers)
- [ ] Handoff bundle contains only current, non-conflicting truth surfaces
- [ ] **Mode C/D additions**: critic-gate dispatched per batch; verdict (if D) committed; per-phase boot evidence on disk
- [ ] **Discipline checks**: §8.1 disk-first verified; §8.2 cites grep-fresh; §8.3 bidirectional grep run on any % claim; §8.4 git staging clean
- [ ] If implementation discovered prior-stage error: §8.7 erratum applied

---

## §11 When to NOT use this SKILL

- Trivial task (typo, single comment fix, obvious one-liner): just do it
- Task already covered by another SKILL (`.claude/skills/zeus-phase-discipline/SKILL.md` for r3 phase work; `zeus-task-boot-*` for specific task classes): use that instead
- Task is purely investigation / research with no commit at the end: use Agent with `explore` subagent_type directly

---

## §12 Maintenance

This SKILL is **living**. Update after each cycle that surfaces new patterns. Cite this SKILL in `docs/runbooks/task_2026-04-19_ai_workflow_bridge.md` and methodology doc as the operational entry point. Cross-reference invariants:

- Methodology doc: `docs/methodology/adversarial_debate_for_project_evaluation.md` (Mode D specifics)
- Phase discipline SKILL: `.claude/skills/zeus-phase-discipline/SKILL.md` (Mode C per-batch)
- Task-boot SKILLs: `.claude/skills/zeus-task-boot-*/SKILL.md` (per-task-class boot profiles)

When promoting to OMC/global skill: copy to `~/.claude/skills/zeus-ai-handoff/SKILL.md` and adjust paths.
