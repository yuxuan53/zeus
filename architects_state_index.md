# architects_state_index.md

Purpose:
- shortest current-state entrypoint for fresh sessions
- minimizes reread cost before packet execution resumes

Metadata:
- Last updated: `2026-04-09 America/Chicago`
- Last updated by: `Codex BUG-LOAD-PORTFOLIO-RECENT-EXITS-TRUTH-MIXING post-close sync`
- Authority scope: `current-state pointer only`

## Current state

- Stage: `post-P7R7 bounded bugfix`
- Active packet: `BUG-LOAD-PORTFOLIO-RECENT-EXITS-TRUTH-MIXING`
- Active packet state: `post_close_passed / next_freeze_allowed`
- Active packet owner: `Architects mainline lead`
- Last accepted packet: `BUG-LOAD-PORTFOLIO-RECENT-EXITS-TRUTH-MIXING`
- Execution mode default: `solo lead with bounded subagents`
- Team status:
  - allowed in principle after `FOUNDATION-TEAM-GATE`
  - no team runtime is active; bounded subagents allowed inside the frozen packet

## Current next action

1. Freeze the next bounded portfolio-truth packet.
2. Keep RiskGuard, DB settlement, and status/output parity work out of this accepted packet unless a new packet is frozen.
3. Preserve the distinction between stopping mixed-source loader truth and claiming full realized-PnL convergence.

- `.trash/` and `memory/` are untracked workspace artifacts outside packet scope
- local DB artifacts (`risk_state.db`, `trading.db`, `zeus.db`, `zeus_state.db`) are untracked and out of scope
- `tests/test_calibration_quality.py` and `work_packets/MATH-002-BIN-HIT-RATE-CALIBRATION.md` are unrelated untracked files outside packet scope
- `zeus_final_tribunal_overlay/` is a tracked reference subtree outside packet scope and must remain untouched
