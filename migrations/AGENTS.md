# migrations AGENTS

Migrations are high-stakes.

## Mandatory
- approved packet
- rollback note
- cutover note
- parity/replay status
- human gate for destructive or live cutover changes

## Do
- make migrations append-safe where possible
- keep canonical truth tables explicit
- document current-phase transitional reads/writes

## Do not
- delete or repurpose legacy tables silently
- claim cutover is complete when reads still route elsewhere
- let migration files become the only explanation of semantic change
