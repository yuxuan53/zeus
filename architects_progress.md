# architects_progress.md

Purpose:
- durable packet-level Architects ledger
- survives session resets and handoffs
- records only real state transitions, accepted evidence, blockers, and next-packet moves

Metadata:
- Last updated: `2026-04-03 America/Chicago`
- Last updated by: `Codex mainline coordination pass`
- Authority scope: `durable packet-level state only`

Do not use this file for:
- every retry
- every test command
- scout breadcrumbs
- timeout notes
- micro evidence dumps

Read order for a fresh leader:
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `architects_state_index.md`
3. `architects_task.md`
4. `architects_progress.md`
5. current active packet

Archive policy:
- Older detailed ledger history now lives in `architects_progress_archive.md`.
- Micro-event evidence now belongs in `.omx/context/architects_worklog.md`.

## Current snapshot

- Mainline stage: `Stage 2 canonical-authority rollout`
- Last accepted packet: `P1.6D-HARVESTER-SETTLEMENT-DUAL-WRITE` (`b6339b9`)
- Current active packet: `P1.7A-RECONCILIATION-LIFECYCLE-EVENT-COMPAT`
- Current packet status: `frozen`
- Team status: allowed in principle after `FOUNDATION-TEAM-GATE`, but current packet remains `solo / no-team-default`
- Current hard blockers:
  - no active technical blocker inside packet scope
  - out-of-scope local dirt must remain excluded from packet commits

## Durable timeline

## [2026-04-03 02:55 America/Chicago] FOUNDATION-TEAM-GATE accepted and pushed
- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `FOUNDATION-TEAM-GATE`
- Status delta:
  - packet accepted
  - packet pushed
  - later packet-by-packet team autonomy became allowed in principle under an explicit gate
- Basis / evidence:
  - accepted gate packet exists in repo truth
  - destructive and cutover work remain human-gated
- Decisions frozen:
  - team use is packet-by-packet only
  - later packets must still freeze owner, scope, verification path, and non-destructive boundaries
- Open uncertainties:
  - actual team use remains packet-specific, not automatic
- Next required action:
  - continue Stage 2 packets and decide team eligibility packet by packet
- Owner:
  - Architects mainline lead

## [2026-04-03 06:01 America/Chicago] P1.6D-HARVESTER-SETTLEMENT-DUAL-WRITE accepted and pushed
- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P1.6D-HARVESTER-SETTLEMENT-DUAL-WRITE`
- Status delta:
  - packet committed as `b6339b9`
  - packet pushed to `origin/Architects`
  - first harvester settlement caller migration became cloud-visible truth
- Basis / evidence:
  - packet stayed confined to harvester settlement path, targeted tests, and control surfaces
- Decisions frozen:
  - canonical settlement writes occur only when prior canonical position history exists
  - legacy settlement writes remain on legacy-schema runtimes
  - no broader reconciliation, parity, or cutover claim is made
- Open uncertainties:
  - reconciliation-family work remains ahead
- Next required action:
  - freeze the reconciliation lifecycle-event compatibility packet
- Owner:
  - Architects mainline lead

## [2026-04-03 06:01 America/Chicago] P1.7A-RECONCILIATION-LIFECYCLE-EVENT-COMPAT frozen
- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P1.7A-RECONCILIATION-LIFECYCLE-EVENT-COMPAT`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - reconciliation is the next remaining P1 dual-write family after cycle-runtime and harvester settlement slices
  - `log_reconciled_entry_event()` still routes through a generic legacy event helper that can fail on canonical-only DBs
- Decisions frozen:
  - keep this slice on reconciliation lifecycle-event compatibility only
  - do not migrate reconciliation caller code in this packet
  - keep team closed by default
- Open uncertainties:
  - exact compatibility semantics still need implementation review
- Next required action:
  - land the compatibility change and targeted tests
  - then run adversarial review
- Owner:
  - Architects mainline lead

## [2026-04-03 06:01 America/Chicago] P1.7A-RECONCILIATION-LIFECYCLE-EVENT-COMPAT landed locally with green targeted evidence
- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P1.7A-RECONCILIATION-LIFECYCLE-EVENT-COMPAT`
- Status delta:
  - touched reconciliation lifecycle-event helper now degrades cleanly on canonically bootstrapped DBs
  - targeted compatibility evidence is green
- Basis / evidence:
  - `python3 scripts/check_work_packets.py` -> `work packet grammar ok`
  - `python3 scripts/check_kernel_manifests.py` -> `kernel manifests ok`
  - `.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_architecture_contracts.py -k 'log_reconciled_entry_event_degrades_cleanly_on_canonical_bootstrap_db or log_reconciled_entry_event_still_fails_loudly_on_malformed_legacy_position_events_schema or log_reconciled_entry_event_still_fails_loudly_on_hybrid_drift_schema or reconciliation_pending_fill_path_remains_blocked_on_canonical_bootstrap_due_to_query_assumptions or harvester_settlement_path_writes_canonical_rows_on_canonical_bootstrap_after_p1_6d or harvester_settlement_path_skips_canonical_write_without_prior_canonical_history or harvester_settlement_path_preserves_legacy_behavior_on_legacy_db or harvester_settlement_dual_write_failure_after_legacy_steps_is_explicit or harvester_settlement_path_uses_day0_window_as_phase_before_when_applicable or harvester_snapshot_source_logging_degrades_cleanly_on_canonical_bootstrap_after_chronicle_compat or settlement_builder or chronicler_log_event_degrades_cleanly_on_canonical_bootstrap_db or log_settlement_event_degrades_cleanly_on_canonical_bootstrap_db or apply_architecture_kernel_schema or transaction_boundary_helper or exposes_canonical_transaction_boundary_helpers or db_no_longer_owns_canonical_append_project_bodies'` -> `22 passed`

- Decisions frozen:
  - generic fail-loud legacy-helper guard remains for malformed legacy and hybrid drift states
  - touched reconciliation lifecycle-event helper now no-ops cleanly on canonical-only DBs
  - reconciliation pending-fill path remains explicitly blocked by separate query assumptions and is not claimed fixed here
  - no reconciliation caller migration is claimed in this packet
  - packet is not migration-safe or cutover-safe by itself
- Open uncertainties:
  - adversarial review has not yet attacked the narrowed reconciliation compatibility claim
- Next required action:
  - run explicit adversarial review before acceptance

  - Architects mainline lead

## [2026-04-03 10:57 America/Chicago] P1.7A-RECONCILIATION-LIFECYCLE-EVENT-COMPAT adversarial review resolved and architect approved

  - critic verdict after narrowed packet claim + synchronized slim control surfaces: `APPROVE`
- Decisions frozen:
  - touched reconciliation lifecycle-event helper now distinguishes canonical bootstrap from malformed legacy and hybrid drift states

  - packet is not migration-safe or cutover-safe by itself

  - the reconciliation query-path blocker is the next packet family
