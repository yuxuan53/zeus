# architects_progress.md

Purpose:
- durable packet-level Architects ledger
- survives session resets and handoffs
- records only real state transitions, accepted evidence, blockers, and next-packet moves

Metadata:
- Last updated: `2026-04-04 America/Chicago`
- Last updated by: `Codex P7R7 post-close boundary`
- Authority scope: `durable packet-level state only`

Do not use this file for:
- every retry
- every test command
- scout breadcrumbs
- timeout notes
- micro evidence dumps

Read order for a fresh leader:
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `architects_state_index.md`
3. `architects_task.md`
4. `architects_progress.md`
5. current active packet

Archive policy:
- Older detailed ledger history now lives in `architects_progress_archive.md`.
- Micro-event evidence now belongs in `.omx/context/architects_worklog.md`.

## Current snapshot

- Mainline stage: `P7 pre-retirement seams complete`
- Last accepted packet: `BUG-LOAD-PORTFOLIO-RECENT-EXITS-TRUTH-MIXING` (accepted locally / post-close passed)
- Current active packet: `BUG-LOAD-PORTFOLIO-RECENT-EXITS-TRUTH-MIXING`
- Current packet status: `post-close passed / next freeze allowed`
- Team status: allowed in principle after `FOUNDATION-TEAM-GATE`, but no team is active
- Current hard blockers:
  - downstream consumers and output layers may still hold older assumptions about `recent_exits` semantics after this loader repair
  - broader realized-PnL/status parity remains unresolved follow-up work outside this accepted boundary

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `BUG-LOAD-PORTFOLIO-RECENT-EXITS-TRUTH-MIXING`
- Status delta:
  - post-close critic review found no blocker-level contradictions on the accepted boundary
  - post-close verifier review found no blocker-level evidence gaps
  - next bounded packet freeze became allowed
- Basis / evidence:
  - native `critic` subagent `Turing` -> `PASS`
  - native `verifier` subagent `Sartre` -> `PASS`
  - fresh direct paper-mode probe remained stable:
    - `load_portfolio(state/positions-paper.json)` -> `positions=12`, `recent_exits=19`, `recent_exit_pnl=-13.03`
    - authoritative paper settlements -> `19`, `pnl=-13.03`
  - fresh JSON-fallback probe remained stable:
    - `positions=1`, `recent_exits=1`, `recent_exit_pnl=1.25`, `first_exit_reason=JSON_FALLBACK`
- Decisions frozen:
  - the loader packet stands on the accepted boundary and should not be silently reopened
  - the next bounded seam is downstream consumer/output parity rather than loader truth mixing itself
- Open uncertainties:
  - the next packet still needs a narrow file boundary and explicit non-goals
- Next required action:
  - freeze the next bounded portfolio-truth packet

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `BUG-LOAD-PORTFOLIO-RECENT-EXITS-TRUTH-MIXING`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - accepted comparator/shadow packet completed post-close review without reopening
  - fresh follow-up probe showed `load_portfolio(state/positions-paper.json)` returning canonical positions (`12`) while preserving contradictory JSON `recent_exits` (`14 / +210.35`)
  - direct authoritative settlement probe on `zeus-paper.db` returned `19` settlements with `pnl=-13.03`
- Decisions frozen:
  - the next bounded seam is loader-level truth mixing in `src/state/portfolio.py`
  - keep RiskGuard, DB settlement authority, and status/output parity explicitly out of this packet
- Open uncertainties:
  - implementation must choose whether DB-first loads clear contradictory `recent_exits` or replace them with canonical settlement exits without widening scope
- Next required action:
  - implement the bounded loader recent-exit truth fix and lock it with packet-bounded tests

- Decisions frozen:
  - same-phase legacy entry/fill shadows no longer force `stale_legacy_fallback`
  - the comparator now keys off the latest semantically advancing legacy event instead of the latest raw legacy timestamp
  - true later semantic lag remains degraded rather than being hidden by a later same-phase shadow row
- Open uncertainties:
  - post-close critic + verifier are still required before the next packet may freeze
  - `load_portfolio()` still carries JSON `recent_exits` / metadata surfaces that can diverge from canonical positions and remain follow-up work outside this packet

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `BUG-PORTFOLIO-LEGACY-TIMESTAMP-SHADOW`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet re-frozen after the mode-aware probe and stage-event dedupe packets cleared the earlier immediate seams
- Basis / evidence:
  - accepted mode-db probe packet removed the wrong-path fallback, and accepted stage-event dedupe packet removed the first active counting seam
  - fresh verification still shows unsuffixed `zeus.db` returns `stale_legacy_fallback` while the mode-correct paper DB is healthy
  - active stale ids remain `trade-1`, `rt1`, and `75c98026-cd5`

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `BUG-LEGACY-SETTLED-STAGE-EVENT-DEDUPE`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - the accepted mode-db probe packet removed the immediate paper fallback trigger, so the next still-live contradiction is settlement summary duplication
  - fresh verification confirmed headline `realized_pnl` comes from `outcome_fact`, while authoritative settlement rows still prefer duplicated legacy `POSITION_SETTLED` stage events
  - direct repro showed duplicate stage events for `0c108102-032`, `6f8ce461-902`, and `9e97c78f-2a8`
- Decisions frozen:
  - supersede the fallback-reader dedupe packet as the immediate next slice
  - keep this packet bounded to stage-event dedupe in `src/state/db.py`
  - do not widen into `src/state/decision_chain.py` fallback cleanup or RiskGuard output-layer parity assertions in this packet
- Open uncertainties:
  - implementation may prove the output layer needs a tiny parity assertion packet afterward, but this packet should not assume that yet

- Status delta:
  - superseded before implementation
- Basis / evidence:
  - fresh verification on the real paper DB showed authoritative settlement rows still duplicate first through `query_settlement_events()`, so fallback-reader dedupe is not the immediate fix for the live mismatch

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `BUG-LOAD-PORTFOLIO-MODED-DB-PROBE`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - post-close-passed trailing-loss packet exposed that the next deeper drift is portfolio truth still degrading to `working_state_fallback`
  - fresh verification on current code shows `query_portfolio_loader_view()` returns `ok` on `zeus-paper.db` but `stale_legacy_fallback` on unsuffixed `zeus.db`
  - `load_portfolio()` still probes the unsuffixed DB path and falls back to JSON with `recent_exits = 14` and `sum_recent_exit_pnl = 210.35`
- Decisions frozen:
  - supersede the just-frozen comparator-only packet as the immediate next slice
  - keep this packet on the mode-aware DB probe in `src/state/portfolio.py`
  - leave comparator cleanup and settlement summary dedupe explicitly open for later packets
- Open uncertainties:
  - implementation may prove `src/state/db.py` must still change immediately, in which case the next packet should be frozen explicitly

- Status delta:
  - superseded before implementation
- Basis / evidence:
  - fresh verification after freeze proved that the active paper fallback symptom is first triggered by `load_portfolio()` probing unsuffixed `zeus.db`, not by the comparator seam alone
- Decisions frozen:

  - `weekly_loss` now means trailing 7d equity loss from trustworthy `risk_state` history
  - degraded history remains visible as `0.0 + YELLOW + no_trustworthy_reference_row`, not silent all-time-baseline reuse
  - deeper portfolio fallback and settlement authority drift remain explicit follow-up debt

## [2026-04-09 09:10 America/Chicago] RISK-TRUTH-01-TRAILING-LOSS-AUTHORITY frozen
- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `RISK-TRUTH-01-TRAILING-LOSS-AUTHORITY`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - user explicitly required `daily_loss` to mean current time minus 24-hour loss, not all-time loss or arbitrary baseline
  - fresh risk-state inspection shows rows ~24h earlier already had `total_pnl = -13.26`, so the current `daily_loss = 13.26` is semantically false
  - many `risk_state-paper.db` rows are internally inconsistent (`effective_bankroll != initial_bankroll + total_pnl`), so reference-row trust must be explicit
  - this symptom also reveals deeper portfolio-fallback and mixed-settlement-authority drift, but those remain follow-up families after this bounded packet
- Decisions frozen:
  - keep packet 1 bounded to trailing-loss authority in riskguard only
  - do not widen into `src/state/**`, `status_summary.py`, portfolio fallback, or settlement-authority unification unless implementation proves a real consumer mismatch
  - degraded trailing-loss truth must be explicit and must not manufacture false RED by itself
- Open uncertainties:
  - how much wider truth drift will be exposed once trailing-loss authority is corrected still needs implementation-time evidence
- Next required action:
  - implement the bounded riskguard helper and targeted tests, then record the next truth-unification slice if needed

  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - accepted truth-repair tip `eecbcb9` is the cleanest integrated mainline boundary available before transport
  - live Architects currently contains real data-expansion changes in `config/cities.json`, `src/main.py`, ETL scripts, and WU collection surfaces
  - live Architects also contains local regressions against accepted truth files (`src/state/db.py`, close-path engine/execution surfaces, and truth tests), so wholesale transport would be dishonest
  - bounded read-only merge analysis isolated the true merge set to additive expansion files plus small `src/main.py` and `tests/test_runtime_guards.py` adaptations

  - keep truth-repair files authoritative
  - preserve the additive data-expansion lane

## [2026-04-05 00:48 America/Chicago] P7.3-M1-OPEN-POSITION-CANONICAL-BACKFILL superseded before implementation
- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P7.3-M1-OPEN-POSITION-CANONICAL-BACKFILL`
- Status delta:
  - frozen packet superseded before implementation
- Basis / evidence:
  - implementation evidence showed append-first canonical seeding is blocked by the legacy `position_events` schema itself
  - projection/event seeding could not land honestly while the event table remained legacy-shaped
- Decisions frozen:
  - P7.3 is not accepted as implemented work
  - the next honest packet must own the event-authority collision directly
- Open uncertainties:
  - none on the superseded P7.3 boundary beyond preserving the supersession note
- Next required action:

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P7R3-LEGACY-POSITION-EVENTS-COLLISION-REPAIR`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
  - mainline moves from the superseded open-position backfill packet into the event-schema collision repair packet
- Basis / evidence:
  - append-first canonical seeding is blocked because runtime DBs still carry the legacy `position_events` table shape
  - freezing a packet that ignores that collision would be dishonest
- Decisions frozen:
  - keep this packet on the event-authority collision only
  - do not claim DB-first reads, cutover, or legacy-surface deletion in this packet
- Open uncertainties:
  - exact repair shape for the event-table collision still needs implementation-time evidence inside the frozen boundary

  - plain SQLite inspection confirms `position_events` and `position_events_legacy` now coexist in `state/zeus.db`
  - pre-close clean-lane PASS via `gemini -p`
- Decisions frozen:
  - canonical append-first seeding is no longer blocked solely by the event-table collision
  - no DB-first cutover or legacy-surface deletion is claimed in this packet

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P5.1-LIFECYCLE-PHASE-KERNEL`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
  - mainline moves from completed P4 into the first P5 lifecycle-phase packet
- Basis / evidence:
  - `docs/architecture/zeus_durable_architecture_spec.md` P5 requires a bounded authoritative lifecycle phase machine with finite vocabulary and fold legality before broader hotspot rewiring
  - `architecture/kernel_manifest.yaml` and `architecture/invariants.yaml` already treat phase grammar as authoritative kernel law
  - current repo truth still keeps canonical phase derivation in `src/engine/lifecycle_events.py` rather than a dedicated lifecycle kernel surface
- Decisions frozen:
  - P5 starts with lifecycle-kernel installation, not broad runtime mutation cleanup
  - this first packet may install a dedicated lifecycle manager surface and delegate current canonical builder phase derivation through it
  - no schema, control-plane, observability, or learning/protection widening is allowed in this packet
- Open uncertainties:
  - whether `src/state/projection.py` needs any support changes or remains untouched after delegation stays implementation-time evidence
- Next required action:
  - implement the lifecycle kernel surface and targeted architecture tests
  - then run pre-close critic + verifier before any acceptance claim

- Basis / evidence:
  - accepted P5.1 boundary plus passed post-close gate now permit the next P5 freeze
  - P5.1 intentionally left later settlement/economic-close folds unlegalized, so fold follow-through is the next narrow lifecycle-engine slice
  - current repo truth still leaves the remaining canonical builder fold behavior partly implicit, especially around settlement-side folds

- Status delta:
  - mainline temporarily diverts from P4.3 implementation into a governance/spec amendment
  - P4.3 remains paused, not rejected
- Basis / evidence:
  - repeated reality drift around finite bin semantics shows discrete settlement support is still below the current authority layer
  - continuing P4.3 before lifting this domain truth would preserve the same false-world-model risk in later packets
- Decisions frozen:
  - discrete settlement support is treated as a P0-class foundation amendment
  - P4.3 remains paused until this authority upgrade is accepted

- Basis / evidence:
  - `docs/architecture/zeus_discrete_settlement_support_amendment.md` landed with accepted authority wording
  - `python3 scripts/check_work_packets.py` -> `work packet grammar ok`
  - control surfaces now explicitly show P4.3 paused behind the accepted amendment rather than silently continuing
  - attempted internal small `$ask` review timed out, but no blocker-level contradiction was found in main-thread review of the amendment/control surfaces
- Decisions frozen:
  - discrete settlement support, bin contract kind, settlement cardinality, and settlement support geometry are now explicit authority concepts
  - future market-math or settlement packets must carry domain assumptions plus authority sources and invalidation conditions
  - P4.3 is paused and must be deliberately resumed under the upgraded authority rather than auto-continuing from stale assumptions

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P1.7G-CHAIN-QUARANTINE-STRATEGY-RESOLUTION`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen as a true stop-boundary blocker
- Basis / evidence:
  - the remaining `CHAIN_QUARANTINED` migration branch has no safe repo-authorized `strategy_key` source for chain-only quarantines
  - autonomous continuation would otherwise require inventing governance attribution
- Decisions frozen:
  - P1 cannot close autonomously before this decision
  - team remains closed by default
- Open uncertainties:
  - exact human governance decision on chain-only quarantine attribution
- Next required action:
  - await human decision, then freeze a superseding packet

## [2026-04-03 13:58 America/Chicago] P1.7G-CHAIN-QUARANTINE-STRATEGY-RESOLUTION resolved by human decision
- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P1.7G-CHAIN-QUARANTINE-STRATEGY-RESOLUTION`
- Status delta:
  - true stop-boundary decision received from the human
  - blocker no longer rests on unresolved strategy-attribution ambiguity
- Basis / evidence:
  - human decision: chain-only quarantines remain outside canonical lifecycle migration in the current phase
  - no lawful strategy-key attribution source exists for chain-only quarantines in current repo truth
- Decisions frozen:
  - chain-only quarantines may not be written into canonical lifecycle truth under current phase law
  - no packet may invent, infer, borrow, or backfill an existing `strategy_key` for these positions
  - any future reconsideration requires a later approved governance-design packet
- Open uncertainties:
  - explicit exclusion visibility and downstream handling still need a narrow successor packet
- Next required action:
  - accept the exclusion-resolution packet and freeze the follow-through packet

- Status delta:
  - mainline packet/control-surface truth now installs the human decision to exclude chain-only quarantines from canonical lifecycle migration in the current phase
  - control-only exclusion resolution is accepted and pushed as a narrow packet step
- Basis / evidence:
  - `python3 scripts/check_work_packets.py` -> `work packet grammar ok`
  - explicit adversarial review on the new resolution/follow-through wording returned `APPROVE` after narrowing the follow-through claim
  - resolution packet freezes the exclusion decision without mixing code or schema changes
- Decisions frozen:
  - current-phase canonical lifecycle migration excludes chain-only quarantines
  - no invented strategy attribution and no new attribution surface are allowed under this resolution
  - observability blind spots must be addressed explicitly rather than by silent skip

- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - `P1.7H` resolved the governance decision but explicitly left follow-through visibility/downstream handling to a narrow successor slice
  - current runtime behavior risks an observability blind spot if exclusion remains only implicit
- Decisions frozen:
  - keep this slice on preserving the quarantined runtime object plus an explicit exclusion warning only

  - slim control surfaces now match the already-landed methodology truth
- Basis / evidence:
  - commit `9db920c` landed `AGENTS.md`, `docs/governance/zeus_autonomous_delivery_constitution.md`, the GOV-01 packet, and the paired slim control surfaces
  - `python3 scripts/check_work_packets.py` -> `work packet grammar ok`
  - focused repo inspection confirmed the methodology doctrine is present in repo-law surfaces while the remaining mismatch was only stale control-state wording
- Decisions frozen:
  - GOV-01 remains a methodology-only governance packet with no runtime or schema claim
  - the next operational step is to freeze the first real P3 packet rather than reopen GOV-01 scope
- Open uncertainties:
  - P3.1 packet scope still needs to be frozen explicitly before implementation begins

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `P3.1-STRATEGY-POLICY-TABLES`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - GOV-01 closeout is now pushed as `e64b187`, so P3 no longer sits on stale methodology control state
  - `docs/architecture/zeus_durable_architecture_spec.md` names `strategy policy tables` as the first P3 slice
  - repo inspection shows `migrations/2026_04_02_architecture_kernel.sql` already contains `risk_actions` / `control_overrides`, while `strategy_health` and the active DB/bootstrap helper layer remain unfinished for P3
  - repo inspection also shows `src/control/control_plane.py` still uses `_control_state` and `src/riskguard/riskguard.py` still writes advisory `risk_state`, so resolver/actuation work remains a later slice
- Decisions frozen:
  - keep this packet on durable strategy-policy table/bootstrap surfaces only
  - do not widen into resolver, evaluator consumption, riskguard emission, or manual override precedence
  - keep team closed by default
- Open uncertainties:
  - the minimum helper/bootstrap surface for `strategy_health` still needs implementation review

- Packet: `BUG-MONITOR-SHARED-CONNECTION-REPAIR`
- Status delta:
  - repaired packet-truth drift inside allowed files
  - restored fresh targeted verification evidence for the monitoring shared-connection seam
- Basis / evidence:

  - removed a duplicate later `get_trade_connection_with_shared()` definition in `src/state/db.py` that had been shadowing the intended trade+shared helper with a legacy-connection variant
  - `src/engine/cycle_runner.py` now keeps the monkeypatch surface but defaults `get_connection` to `get_trade_connection_with_shared()` so runtime monitoring uses the explicit trade+shared seam by default
  - `tests/test_runtime_guards.py` now binds the shared-present seam test to the mode-scoped trade DB path rather than the legacy `ZEUS_DB_PATH` path

- Decisions frozen:
  - keep the packet bounded to the single-source-of-truth monitoring seam, not bankroll, RiskGuard, migration, or daemon cutover work
  - preserve `cycle_runner.get_connection` as the injection surface for tests while making the default runtime path truthful

- Author: `Architects mainline lead`
- Packet: `BUG-BANKROLL-TRUTH-CONSISTENCY`
- Status delta:
  - current active packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:
  - `docs/session_2026_04_07_final_state.md` still flags `effective_bankroll=$579.58 vs wallet=$93.68` as unresolved and separately flags RiskGuard/status-summary bankroll semantics drift
  - `src/engine/cycle_runtime.py::entry_bankroll_for_cycle()` still derives paper entry bankroll from `portfolio.effective_bankroll` alone (`142-153`)
  - `src/riskguard/riskguard.py::_load_riskguard_portfolio_truth()` still rebuilds a fresh `PortfolioState` with reset bankroll/baseline/recent-exit semantics (`73-97`)
  - `src/observability/status_summary.py` still fabricates `effective_bankroll` from `total_pnl` when risk details are missing and still drops regime scoping by passing `not_before=None` (`221-259`)
  - existing tests already expose the touched seams: `test_inv_kelly_uses_effective_bankroll`, `test_inv_riskguard_reads_real_pnl`, RiskGuard portfolio-truth tests, and status-summary regime-scoping tests
- Decisions frozen:
  - treat bankroll truth as the next K-level cross-module loss after the monitoring seam, because it directly affects trade sizing, risk interpretation, and operator observability in both paper and live simulation
  - keep this packet bounded to entry/risk/operator bankroll semantics only
  - leave control-plane durability, lifecycle closure/projection traceability, and ETL/recalibration contamination as later packet families
- Open uncertainties:
  - whether the minimal repair can stay inside consumer semantics or needs one small shared contract helper
  - whether RiskGuard baselines can be preserved without widening into broader portfolio-truth migration

  - `src/observability/status_summary.py` now falls back from `settings.capital_base_usd` when `initial_bankroll` is absent instead of fabricating bankroll from `total_pnl`, and it passes `current_regime_started_at` through to execution/learning summary queries

  - current repair packet frozen
- Basis / evidence:

  - the latest `risk_state-paper.db` row still reports `portfolio_truth_source = working_state_fallback`, proving the closed packet did not converge runtime truth on the active mode
  - because later repo truth disproved the earlier closure claim, repo law requires explicit reopen/repair before further packet advancement
