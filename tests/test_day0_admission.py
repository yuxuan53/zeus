# Authority basis: operator delta-package v2 (real_upgrade #3) — Day0 live admission circuit breakers.
"""Contract tests for day0_live_admission_rejection_reason (7 gates + admit + bypass).

M-3 (Day0 first-principles audit 2026-07-18): `in_post_extreme_quiet_window`
(former gate 6) was deleted — see the commit body and day0_admission.py's gate
6 comment for why it was judged redundant with the strict quote>observation
ordering gate + the H-2 submit-time hard-fact re-check.

M-13 (receipt-persistence audit 2026-07-19): the former gate 1, city_allowlist,
was deleted along with the ``city``/``city_allowlist`` fields — see
day0_admission.py's deleted-gate-1 comment. The sole live call site built the
allowlist from the candidate's own city, so the gate could never fire; no real
per-city stage concept exists, and the operator's 06-09/06-12 directives already
foreclosed staged/canary Day0 rollout before this module was even created.
