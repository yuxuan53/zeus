# Created: 2026-07-12

# Authority basis: live DB evidence — ~27 position_current rows in the last 7d

#   (EXIT_ORDER_FILLED, phase=economically_closed) silently clobbered to 0.0
#   when the harvester later settled the underlying market.
"""Bug B antibody: a position that exits BEFORE settlement must keep its
booked realized P&L / exit_price through the settlement reload+reproject.

BUG #128 made the write path durable (position_current.realized_pnl_usd /
exit_price persist through build_position_current_projection). R0-a
(close-economics unification, 2026-07-08) made the exit-before-settlement
FILL writers (command_recovery / exchange_reconcile) book the correct
realized_pnl_usd/exit_price at economic close (see
tests/execution/test_exit_before_settlement_realized_pnl.py).

But the READ side never closed the loop: `_position_from_projection_row`
(src/state/portfolio.py) builds the runtime `Position` from an explicit
field-by-field payload dict, and that dict never maps the row's
`realized_pnl_usd` column onto `Position.pnl` (names differ, so the generic
"copy any remaining dataclass field with the same name" loop at the bottom of
the function can't match it either) — nor does it map `exit_price`. Depending
on daemon restart timing, ANY economically_closed row gets reloaded with
Position.pnl=0.0 / Position.exit_price=0.0 (dataclass defaults) regardless of
what was durably booked.

`compute_settlement_close` correctly refuses to recompute pnl/exit_price for
a `was_economically_closed` position (it trusts the already-closed values) —
but it does still stamp `pos.last_exit_at = now`. `_has_realized_close`
(src/engine/lifecycle_events.py) uses non-empty `last_exit_at` as the "this
position has real close economics" proxy, so once `last_exit_at` is stamped,
`_settled_economics_value` happily projects the DEFAULTED pnl=0.0/
exit_price=0.0 as if it were real economics, and the SETTLED write clobbers
the correctly-booked values with zero.

Fix: hydrate `pnl` <- row `realized_pnl_usd` and `exit_price` <- row
`exit_price` in `_position_from_projection_row` (only when the row's value is
not NULL, so BUG #128's NULL-vs-0.0 distinction for OPEN positions is
preserved), and extend `query_portfolio_loader_view`
(src/state/db.py) to actually select those columns (it did not select them at
all before this fix).
