"""Antibody tests for the day0 EV gate stale-probability failure.

Root cause (2026-04-07): When the day0 signal falls back to stale p_posterior
(observation/ENS data unavailable), fresh_prob_is_fresh=False. This caused
evaluate_exit() to return INCOMPLETE_EXIT_CONTEXT, silently holding extreme-tail
buy_yes positions to settlement and losing the full stake.

Fix: day0 positions with only fresh_prob_is_fresh missing are allowed through.
In _buy_yes_exit, when fresh_prob_is_fresh=False, the EV gate uses
min(stale_prob, best_bid * 1.1) instead of the stale entry probability.
