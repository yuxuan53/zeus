# Purpose: RELATIONSHIP TESTS for process-topology refactor STEP 4 — remove the
#   verified-duplicate `wu_daily` dispatch from the order daemon (src.main). The WU
#   daily-observation concern is OWNED by data-ingest (`_k2_daily_obs_tick` ->
#   `daily_obs_append.daily_tick`); the src.main copy (`_wu_daily_dispatch` ->
#   `wu_scheduler.run_wu_daily_dispatch`) is a verified set-equivalent duplicate.
#
# These tests verify CROSS-MODULE INVARIANTS (Module A's slice vs Module B's slice),
# not just function behavior:
#   (NO-REGRESSION) the WU-collection slice that DATA-INGEST runs (daily_tick) is
#     SET-EQUIVALENT to what src.main's removed path ran — re-verified here against the
#     actual source (same iteration source, same wu_icao filter, same per-city gate, same
#     target-date math, same writer), so removing the src.main copy loses ZERO city
#     coverage; the data-ingest collector is still scheduled and still writes via the
#     sanctioned INV-37 ATTACH path; src.main STILL IMPORTS (never break boot).
#   (SUPERIORITY) src.main registers exactly ONE FEWER (duplicate) job: `wu_daily` is no
#     longer an add_job id in src.main and `_wu_daily_dispatch` is no longer defined there;
#     the resolved active-duplicate is gone from BOTH the registry's known-open map AND the
#     live duplicate-owner detection (no more double WU-API fetch / rebuild_run_id clobber).
