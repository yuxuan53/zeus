# Created: 2026-06-03
# Last reused or audited: 2026-09-08
# Authority basis: 守護 blocker — settlement_outcomes (VERIFIED truth) -> resolver ->
#   position settled. Relationship test across the
#   settlement_outcomes -> position_current boundary that the
#   "harvester unscheduled in EDLI" bug left dead (memory #56 Shanghai cca68b44).
# Lifecycle: created=2026-06-03; last_reviewed=2026-07-25; last_reused=2026-07-25
# Purpose: Cross-module relationship invariant — when a position's target_date has a
#   VERIFIED settlement_outcomes row, running the resolver marks the position settled.
# Reuse: inspect src/engine/harvest_cycle.py:_resolve_settlements and
#   src/state/db.py settlement_outcomes/position_current tables
#   before re-running; verify zeus-forecasts.db and zeus_trades.db schemas match.
# 2026-07-25 update: on-chain redemption decoupled entirely (Zeus no longer
#   submits redeem transactions; Polymarket settles win/loss on our behalf).
#   test_resolver_settles_position_and_enqueues_redeem_intent asserted a
#   REDEEM_INTENT_CREATED row was enqueued — removed, since enqueue_redeem_command
#   was deleted from src/execution/harvester.py. The remaining tests in this file
#   are independent of redeem/settlement_commands and are unchanged.
"""Relationship test: resolver consumes VERIFIED settlement truth -> settle.

This crosses the exact boundary the scheduling bug broke:
  forecasts.settlement_outcomes (VERIFIED)  ->  trade.position_current (settled)

Without the harvester scheduled, this whole chain never fires in EDLI modes.
