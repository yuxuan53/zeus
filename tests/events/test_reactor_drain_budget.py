# Authority basis: GOAL #83 continuous-fills limiter (docs/evidence/qkernel_rebuild/
#   fix_reactor_drain_budget_2026-06-16.md). The end-of-cycle substrate-refresh drain
#   (_drain_substrate_refreshes / _drain_one_bucket) refreshed EVERY blocked family with no
#   per-cycle bound; with ~49 blocked families that is ~49 /book network fetches per cycle, blowing
#   the reactor's 60s schedule and coalescing it into multi-minute gaps -> ~1 family decided/cycle.
#   These tests pin the BACKGROUND-I/O wall-clock budget (ZEUS_REACTOR_DRAIN_BUDGET_SECONDS) that
#   bounds the drain: it stops after the current family (never mid-network), retains the unreached
#   families for a later cycle, drains held-position families first under ordinary budget pressure,
#   yields even that background I/O to an active held-monitor handoff, and preserves fail-soft.
#   This is NOT a money-path cap — decisions, the 30s
#   decision budget, the fair rotation, and every money-path gate are untouched.
"""Drain-budget tests for the #83 continuous-fills limiter.

The reactor's end-of-cycle substrate-refresh DRAIN is bounded by a per-cycle wall-clock budget so a
large blocked-family set can no longer overrun the 60s schedule. The budget is a background-I/O time
bound (identical in kind to the warm-cycle ZEUS_REACTOR_REFRESH_BUDGET_SECONDS), not a money-path
cap: held-position families are always drained first and the unreached tail is simply deferred to a
later cycle, where the fair-cursor rotation advances it toward the front (no starvation).
