#   + critic-proven root: zeus-world.db WAL bloat = checkpoint-starvation by
#     long-lived reader connections pinning the WAL floor (NOT I/O under the
#     world mutex). Live evidence: while a reader pins the floor,
#     PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE) copies fewer frames than the log holds
#     (checkpointed_frames < log_frames) and never truncates. Correction
#     2026-07-21 (audit finding W5-2): PASSIVE's busy field is ALWAYS 0 — it
#     is 1 only for a blocked RESTART/FULL/TRUNCATE checkpoint, never PASSIVE.
# Lifecycle: created=2026-06-04; last_reviewed=2026-07-27; last_reused=2026-07-27
# Purpose: RED→GREEN relationship test for the WAL checkpoint-starvation fix.
#   Proves the MECHANISM (a reader that never ends its read transaction pins
#   the WAL floor so TRUNCATE returns BUSY and the WAL stays large) AND the FIX
#   (releasing the snapshot per-cycle + a fail-fast TRUNCATE after PASSIVE has
#   fully drained the WAL truncates the file to ~zero).
# Reuse: run on any PR touching src/state/db.py checkpoint helpers, the EDLI
#   reactor read-connection lifecycle, or the checkpoint scheduler job.

"""WAL checkpoint-starvation relationship test.

In SQLite WAL mode a read connection holds a snapshot (its read mark) from its
first SELECT until it COMMITs / ROLLBACKs / closes. The checkpointer can only
reclaim WAL frames OLDER than the oldest active reader's mark. A read-only
connection that polls in a loop but never ends its read transaction therefore
pins the WAL floor forever → wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE) returns BUSY (busy=1) →
the -wal file grows unboundedly with every write.

The fix has two parts:
  1. Each long-lived world-DB READ connection that polls in a loop ends its read
     transaction between cycles (conn.rollback()/commit()) so its WAL read-mark
     advances WITHOUT closing the connection.
  2. A periodic scheduler job runs PASSIVE, then attempts a fail-fast TRUNCATE
     only after PASSIVE fully drains a materially allocated WAL.

This test reproduces the disease at the raw-SQLite level (no production import
needed for the mechanism proof) using literal TRUNCATE calls, since TRUNCATE is
the mode where "BUSY while a reader pins the floor" / "shrinks once released"
is easiest to observe directly. Probe 3 then asserts what the production
helper (``checkpoint_wal``) runs PASSIVE for live-writer priority. Probe 4
covers the separate fail-fast TRUNCATE helper, and the scheduler probes prove
it is called only for an already-drained, materially allocated WAL.
