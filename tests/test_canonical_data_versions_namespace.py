# Lifecycle: created=2026-04-24; last_reviewed=2026-04-24; last_reused=never
# Purpose: M3 antibody — pins the CANONICAL_DATA_VERSIONS →
#          CANONICAL_ENSEMBLE_DATA_VERSIONS rename + parallel observation
#          + settlement allowlists. Renames drift fast; this test catches
#          accidental re-merge of the namespaces or silent removal of
#          parallel sets.
# Reuse: Covers src/contracts/ensemble_snapshot_provenance.py public
#        constants only. Not a write-path test; no DB connection needed.
#        Originating handoff: POST_AUDIT_HANDOFF_2026-04-24.md §3.1 M3.
# Authority basis: T2-S4 M3 namespace disambiguation.
