#   Slice C source-content-bound cutover repair; exercised only against tiny
#   disposable fixtures, never against live zeus_trades.db.
#   (bounded-by-construction storage redesign, Slice C). Writer-plane fence pattern
#   is scripts/migrations/2026_07_quarantine_phase_retirement.py's
#   _live_zeus_processes/_assert_writer_plane_fenced (T5 migration), reused near-
#   verbatim: "No machine-checkable global writer fence exists in this repo (rg
#   confirmed entries_paused only pauses NEW entries, not monitor/exit/settlement/
#   reconcile writers)". Backup manifest format is scripts/ops/backup_canonical_dbs.py's
#   output. Precondition style (open-position gate, backup-ack, FK-ordered/staged
#   execution) follows scripts/ops/archive_pre_epoch_trades.py.
#
# This script has only been exercised against disposable tiny SQLite fixtures;
# --vacuum-into and --swap have never executed against zeus_trades.db or any
# live database. An operator runs this once, by hand, in a maintenance window.
"""One-time VACUUM reset for zeus_trades.db: the only way freed retention pages
(from items 11-13's DELETE-based retention, all of which leave auto_vacuum=0's
freelist internal rather than shrinking the file) actually return to the OS.

Three explicit phases, run as separate commands so an operator can stop and
inspect between each:

  1. --check           Read-only. Verifies every precondition. Never writes
                        anything. Safe to run repeatedly, any time.
  2. --vacuum-into DEST Re-verifies --check's preconditions, then runs
                        `VACUUM INTO DEST` against a READ-ONLY connection to the
                        live source DB (the live DB itself is never opened for
                        write by this phase), integrity-checks DEST, converts
                        DEST to auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL (see AUTO_VACUUM
                        CONVERSION below), and writes a receipt JSON recording
                        DEST's path + sha256, source content/path binding, row
                        counts per table, and the integrity-check result. Does
                        NOT touch the live file.
  3. --swap DEST --operator-confirms-fenced
                        Requires a receipt from phase 2 proving DEST passed
                        integrity check, the writer-plane fence (see below),
                        and re-verifies --check's preconditions one more time
                        (state can have changed between phases). Atomically
                        renames the live DB out of the way, moves DEST into its
                        place, and re-verifies integrity on the file now at the
                        live path before declaring success. On ANY failure
                        after the live path has been touched, restores the
                        original database and any source WAL/SHM sidecars from
                        the pre-swap rename.

PRECONDITIONS (checked by --check and re-checked by every later phase):
  - Writer-plane fenced: --operator-confirms-fenced (required, no default) PLUS
    a `ps`-based scan for any running zeus daemon process (same two-part fence
    as the T5 migration -- no machine-checkable global writer fence exists in
    this repo; entries_paused only pauses NEW entries, not monitor/exit/
    settlement/reconcile writers). --check and --vacuum-into do NOT require
    --operator-confirms-fenced (they never write to the live file); only
    --swap does.
  - Zero open positions: `position_current` has zero rows outside the terminal
    phases (settled, economically_closed, admin_closed, voided) -- verified
    live 2026-08-25 (see items 11/12): this is CURRENTLY true. If the operator
    cannot get to zero open positions, entries_paused (control_plane) is
    accepted as an alternative precondition per the operator's original
    instruction ("entries paused OR zero open positions") -- but note
    entries_paused does NOT stop monitor/exit/settlement/reconcile writers, so
    the writer-plane fence above is still mandatory regardless.
  - Backup manifest: --backup-manifest PATH pointing at a manifest produced by
    scripts/ops/backup_canonical_dbs.py, dated within --backup-max-age-hours
    (default 24) of now, whose entries include zeus_trades.db with a verified
    dest_sha256.
  - Source integrity: `PRAGMA integrity_check` on the live DB returns exactly
    ["ok"].
  - Free space at DEST's directory: at least 1.2x the CURRENT live file size
    (conservative -- the whole point is the output should be much smaller, but
    the check must not assume that before it has actually measured it).

SIZE ASSERTIONS (phase 2, after VACUUM INTO):
  - DEST integrity_check returns exactly ["ok"].
  - DEST size < SOURCE size (VACUUM INTO must never produce something larger;
    if it did, something is wrong -- refuse and do not proceed to swap).
  - DEST size > SOURCE size * MIN_PLAUSIBLE_RATIO (0.05) -- guards against a
    catastrophically incomplete copy silently passing a naive "smaller is
    good" check.
  - Per-table row counts in DEST match the source view used for VACUUM INTO.
    The count and VACUUM INTO use one read-only connection, but SQLite does not
    make those separate statements a cross-statement snapshot. A same-connection
    data_version plus stable main/WAL content binding is checked before and
    after VACUUM INTO, and swap revalidates that binding.

AUTO_VACUUM CONVERSION: `PRAGMA auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL` is set on the
connection BEFORE `VACUUM INTO` runs, which (per SQLite's VACUUM semantics --
VACUUM INTO performs the same rebuild-into-a-fresh-file mechanism as VACUUM,
just targeting a new path) should produce DEST already in incremental mode.
This script does NOT trust that assumption blindly: after VACUUM INTO, it
opens DEST separately and reads back `PRAGMA auto_vacuum`. If it is not `2`
(incremental), the script runs `PRAGMA auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL; VACUUM;`
directly on DEST (cheap -- DEST is already small) and re-verifies before
proceeding. Verify-then-fix, never assume-and-proceed.

AFTER THE SWAP: src/state/decision_chain.py::_inline_expire_decision_log,
src/state/snapshot_repo.py::_inline_expire_executable_market_snapshots, and
src/events/triggers/market_channel_ingestor.py::
_inline_expire_execution_feasibility_evidence (item 13, Slice B) each already
call `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum(1000)` on every write -- a no-op today because
auto_vacuum=0 live, but it activates automatically the moment this reset makes
auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL true. No further code changes are needed after the
swap for the DB to start shrinking in steady state.
