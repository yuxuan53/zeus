# scripts AGENTS

Scripts here are enforcement, audit, runtime support, or operator tools.

## Do
- keep script purpose narrow
- distinguish blocking gates from advisory checks
- make external-workspace assumptions explicit
- fail loudly on stale authority where appropriate

## Do not
- let scripts become hidden authority centers
- write directly to canonical truth except explicitly approved migration/support tooling
- block CI on external files that are outside repo control unless policy says so
