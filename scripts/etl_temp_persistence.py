"""ETL: Temperature persistence from daily observations.

Source: zeus-forecasts.db:observations (canonical daily observations)
Target: zeus-world.db:temp_persistence

Computes day-over-day temperature change distribution per city×season.
Used for ENS anomaly detection: when ENS predicts a 10°F drop but persistence
data says that only happens 5% of the time → flag and widen CI.
