"""Dynamic α validation v2: uses raw forecast_skill (53K rows) instead of aggregated model_skill (20 rows).

Key improvements over v1:
1. Uses actual per-lead-day MAE instead of season-level aggregate
2. Computes true p_posterior via proper bin-probability calculation  
3. Tests non-linear α mappings (logistic, piecewise) alongside linear
4. Go/No-Go criteria: Brier improvement > 0.01 across 5+ city-season combos
