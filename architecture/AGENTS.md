Supersedes / harmonizes: informal architecture claims in historical docs.
Why this file exists now: this is the K0/K1 law zone and needs narrower instructions than the repo root.

# architecture AGENTS

This directory contains machine-checkable and constitutional authority surfaces.

Module book: `docs/reference/modules/topology_system.md`

## Treat this zone as high sensitivity
Changes here are architecture or governance changes, never “just docs.”

## Required before edit
- approved packet
- explicit invariant references
- list of touched authority surfaces
- statement of what existing surface this change harmonizes or supersedes

## Do
- keep manifests, constitution, and spec mutually consistent
- prefer delta over rewrite
- preserve descriptive vs normative distinction
- record migration drift instead of hiding it

## Do not
- create parallel authority files
- copy historical rationale into active law without saying so
- claim runtime convergence unless current code actually matches
- widen semantics by convenience

## Subdirectory navigation

Each subdirectory has its own `AGENTS.md` with file registry and rules:

| Subdirectory | AGENTS.md | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| `ast_rules/` | `ast_rules/AGENTS.md` | AST-level enforcement rules (Semgrep + forbidden patterns) |
| `packet_templates/` | `packet_templates/AGENTS.md` | Work packet templates for change classification |
| `self_check/` | `self_check/AGENTS.md` | Agent entry checklists |

## Review rule
At least one independent verifier must read the final diff before acceptance.
