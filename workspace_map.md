# Zeus Workspace Map

This is the root visibility and routing guide for zero-context agents.

Use it after `AGENTS.md` to answer two questions quickly:

1. what kind of surface am I looking at?
2. what should I read next?

## Default route

1. read `AGENTS.md` (establishes the money path and probability chain)
2. run the topology digest for your task — this gives a compact route,
   context, and candidate-file orientation:
   `python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --navigation --task "<task>" --files <files>`
3. read the scoped `AGENTS.md` for the module the digest routes you to
4. read code and evidence only after the route is narrow

## Visibility classes

| Class | Meaning | Examples | Default posture |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| tracked visible text | Tracked human-readable routing, law, plans, and docs | `AGENTS.md`, `workspace_map.md`, `docs/**`, `architecture/**` | Default-read when relevant |
| tracked derived context | Tracked artifacts that help review and retrieval but are not authority | `.code-review-graph/graph.db` | Read as derived context, never as law |
| historical cold storage | Historical bodies and bundles that may exist locally but are not part of the default boot path | `docs/archives/**`, local archive bundles | Do not default-read; route through `docs/archive_registry.md` |
| runtime-local scratch and control | Runtime state, DBs, coordination files, and ignored planning scratch | `state/**`, `.omx/**`, `.omc/**` | Treat as runtime context, not repo law |
| generated evidence sinks | Dated evidence packets and raw captures | `docs/operations/live_egress/**`, `docs/operations/sd3_validation_evidence/**`; artifacts/historical_evidence untracked on disk | Evidence only unless promoted through a packet |

## Root reference docs

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `SYSTEM_CARD.md` | Claims/evidence/limits snapshot for external readers |
| `AI_ASSISTANCE.md` | What AI-assistance metrics measure and don't, what stays human, documented control failures |

## Do not default-read

- `docs/archives/**` and local archive bundles
- `.code-review-graph/graph.db` as if it were authority
- the `lab` branch (dated investigations and rebuild notes, no shared history
  with `live`) as if branch placement made it law
- `docs/reference/modules/*.md` before a scoped router or module manifest says
  which module actually matters
- `.omx/context/**` and `.omc/**` runtime scratch
- long reference docs unless the digest or packet routes you there

Packet docs, ADRs, fix-pack notes, rollback doctrine, and date-scoped boundary
notes must not remain in `docs/authority/`. If still useful, keep them as
operations packet evidence, reports evidence, or archive-indexed history.

## Maintenance rule

When adding, renaming, or deleting a file:

1. update the owning manifest when one exists
2. update the scoped `AGENTS.md` if the local router changed
3. update this file only when directory-level structure or visibility classes
   changed

Run:

`python3 scripts/topology_doctor.py --context-budget --json`

after a material boot-surface rewrite.
